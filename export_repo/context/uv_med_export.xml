## Installation

Install uv with our standalone installers:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
```

Or, from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/):

```bash
# With pip.
pip install uv
```

```bash
# Or pipx.
pipx install uv
```

If installed via the standalone installer, uv can update itself to the latest version:

```bash
uv self update
```

See the [installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
details and alternative installation methods.

## Documentation

uv's documentation is available at [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

Additionally, the command line reference documentation can be viewed with `uv help`.

## Features

### Projects

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.0

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they're not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/) to learn more.

### Scripts

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo 'import requests; print(requests.get(&quot;https://astral.sh&quot;))' &gt; example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

See the [scripts documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to get started.

### Tools

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay 'hello world!'
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  ------------
&lt; hello world! &gt;
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.0
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

See the [tools documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to get started.

### Python versions

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using Python 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python --version
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [Python installation documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) to get
started.

### The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows ‚Äî and experience a 10-100x speedup ‚Äî with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4

## Dependency caching

uv uses aggressive caching to avoid re-downloading (and re-building) dependencies that have already
been accessed in prior runs.

The specifics of uv's caching semantics vary based on the nature of the dependency:

- **For registry dependencies** (like those downloaded from PyPI), uv respects HTTP caching headers.
- **For direct URL dependencies**, uv respects HTTP caching headers, and also caches based on the
  URL itself.
- **For Git dependencies**, uv caches based on the fully-resolved Git commit hash. As such,
  `uv pip compile` will pin Git dependencies to a specific commit hash when writing the resolved
  dependency set.
- **For local dependencies**, uv caches based on the last-modified time of the source archive (i.e.,
  the local `.whl` or `.tar.gz` file). For directories, uv caches based on the last-modified time of
  the `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `setup.cfg` file.

If you're running into caching issues, uv includes a few escape hatches:

- To force uv to revalidate cached data for all dependencies, pass `--refresh` to any command (e.g.,
  `uv sync --refresh` or `uv pip install --refresh ...`).
- To force uv to revalidate cached data for a specific dependency pass `--refresh-package` to any
  command (e.g., `uv sync --refresh-package flask` or `uv pip install --refresh-package flask ...`).
- To force uv to ignore existing installed versions, pass `--reinstall` to any installation command
  (e.g., `uv sync --reinstall` or `uv pip install --reinstall ...`).

As a special case, uv will always rebuild and reinstall any local directory dependencies passed
explicitly on the command-line (e.g., `uv pip install .`).

## Dynamic metadata

By default, uv will _only_ rebuild and reinstall local directory dependencies (e.g., editables) if
the `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `setup.cfg` file in the directory root has changed, or if a
`src` directory is added or removed. This is a heuristic and, in some cases, may lead to fewer
re-installs than desired.

To incorporate additional information into the cache key for a given package, you can add cache key
entries under [`tool.uv.cache-keys`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#cache-keys),
which covers both file paths and Git commit hashes. Setting
[`tool.uv.cache-keys`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#cache-keys) will replace
defaults, so any necessary files (like `pyproject.toml`) should still be included in the
user-defined cache keys.

For example, if a project specifies dependencies in `pyproject.toml` but uses
[`setuptools-scm`](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/) to manage its version, and should thus
be rebuilt whenever the commit hash or dependencies change, you can add the following to the
project's `pyproject.toml`:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }, { git = { commit = true } }]
```

If your dynamic metadata incorporates information from the set of Git tags, you can expand the cache
key to include the tags:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }, { git = { commit = true, tags = true } }]
```

Similarly, if a project reads from a `requirements.txt` to populate its dependencies, you can add
the following to the project's `pyproject.toml`:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }, { file = &quot;requirements.txt&quot; }]
```

Globs are supported for `file` keys, following the syntax of the
[`glob`](https://docs.rs/glob/0.3.1/glob/struct.Pattern.html) crate. For example, to invalidate the
cache whenever a `.toml` file in the project directory or any of its subdirectories is modified, use
the following:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;**/*.toml&quot; }]
```

!!! note

    The use of globs can be expensive, as uv may need to walk the filesystem to determine whether any files have changed.
    This may, in turn, requiring traversal of large or deeply nested directories.

Similarly, if a project relies on an environment variable, you can add the following to the
project's `pyproject.toml` to invalidate the cache whenever the environment variable changes:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }, { env = &quot;MY_ENV_VAR&quot; }]
```

Finally, to invalidate a project whenever a specific directory (like `src`) is created or removed,
add the following to the project's `pyproject.toml`:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }, { dir = &quot;src&quot; }]
```

Note that the `dir` key will only track changes to the directory itself, and not arbitrary changes
within the directory.

As an escape hatch, if a project uses `dynamic` metadata that isn't covered by `tool.uv.cache-keys`,
you can instruct uv to _always_ rebuild and reinstall it by adding the project to the
`tool.uv.reinstall-package` list:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
reinstall-package = [&quot;my-package&quot;]
```

This will force uv to rebuild and reinstall `my-package` on every run, regardless of whether the
package's `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `setup.cfg` file has changed.

## Cache safety

It's safe to run multiple uv commands concurrently, even against the same virtual environment. uv's
cache is designed to be thread-safe and append-only, and thus robust to multiple concurrent readers
and writers. uv applies a file-based lock to the target virtual environment when installing, to
avoid concurrent modifications across processes.

Note that it's _not_ safe to modify the uv cache (e.g., `uv cache clean`) while other uv commands
are running, and _never_ safe to modify the cache directly (e.g., by removing a file or directory).

## Clearing the cache

uv provides a few different mechanisms for removing entries from the cache:

- `uv cache clean` removes _all_ cache entries from the cache directory, clearing it out entirely.
- `uv cache clean ruff` removes all cache entries for the `ruff` package, useful for invalidating
  the cache for a single or finite set of packages.
- `uv cache prune` removes all _unused_ cache entries. For example, the cache directory may contain
  entries created in previous uv versions that are no longer necessary and can be safely removed.
  `uv cache prune` is safe to run periodically, to keep the cache directory clean.

## Caching in continuous integration

It's common to cache package installation artifacts in continuous integration environments (like
GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) to speed up subsequent runs.

By default, uv caches both the wheels that it builds from source and the pre-built wheels that it
downloads directly, to enable high-performance package installation.

However, in continuous integration environments, persisting pre-built wheels may be undesirable.
With uv, it turns out that it's often faster to _omit_ pre-built wheels from the cache (and instead
re-download them from the registry on each run). On the other hand, caching wheels that are built
from source tends to be worthwhile, since the wheel building process can be expensive, especially
for extension modules.

To support this caching strategy, uv provides a `uv cache prune --ci` command, which removes all
pre-built wheels and unzipped source distributions from the cache, but retains any wheels that were
built from source. We recommend running `uv cache prune --ci` at the end of your continuous
integration job to ensure maximum cache efficiency. For an example, see the
[GitHub integration guide](../guides/integration/github.md#caching).

## Cache directory

uv determines the cache directory according to, in order:

1. A temporary cache directory, if `--no-cache` was requested.
2. The specific cache directory specified via `--cache-dir`, `UV_CACHE_DIR`, or
   [`tool.uv.cache-dir`](../reference/settings.md#cache-dir).
3. A system-appropriate cache directory, e.g., `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on Unix and
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows

!!! note

    uv _always_ requires a cache directory. When `--no-cache` is requested, uv will still use
    a temporary cache for sharing data within that single invocation.

    In most cases, `--refresh` should be used instead of `--no-cache` ‚Äî as it will update the cache
    for subsequent operations but not read from the cache.

It is important for performance for the cache directory to be located on the same file system as the
Python environment uv is operating on. Otherwise, uv will not be able to link files from the cache
into the environment and will instead need to fallback to slow copy operations.

## Cache versioning

The uv cache is composed of a number of buckets (e.g., a bucket for wheels, a bucket for source
distributions, a bucket for Git repositories, and so on). Each bucket is versioned, such that if a
release contains a breaking change to the cache format, uv will not attempt to read from or write to
an incompatible cache bucket.

For example, uv 0.4.13 included a breaking change to the core metadata bucket. As such, the bucket
version was increased from v12 to v13. Within a cache version, changes are guaranteed to be both
forwards- and backwards-compatible.

Since changes in the cache format are accompanied by changes in the cache version, multiple versions
of uv can safely read and write to the same cache directory. However, if the cache version changed
between a given pair of uv releases, then those releases may not be able to share the same
underlying cache entries.

For example, it's safe to use a single shared cache for uv 0.4.12 and uv 0.4.13, though the cache
itself may contain duplicate entries in the core metadata bucket due to the change in cache version.

        <file path="docs/concepts/python-versions.md"># Python versions

A Python version is composed of a Python interpreter (i.e. the `python` executable), the standard
library, and other supporting files.

## Managed and system Python installations

Since it is common for a system to have an existing Python installation, uv supports
[discovering](#discovery-of-python-versions) Python versions. However, uv also supports
[installing Python versions](#installing-a-python-version) itself. To distinguish between these two
types of Python installations, uv refers to Python versions it installs as _managed_ Python
installations and all other Python installations as _system_ Python installations.

!!! note

    uv does not distinguish between Python versions installed by the operating system vs those
    installed and managed by other tools. For example, if a Python installation is managed with
    `pyenv`, it would still be considered a _system_ Python version in uv.

## Requesting a version

A specific Python version can be requested with the `--python` flag in most uv commands. For
example, when creating a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.11.6
```

uv will ensure that Python 3.11.6 is available ‚Äî downloading and installing it if necessary ‚Äî then
create the virtual environment with it.

The following Python version request formats are supported:

- `&lt;version&gt;` (e.g., `3`, `3.12`, `3.12.3`)
- `&lt;version-specifier&gt;` (e.g., `&gt;=3.12,&lt;3.13`)
- `&lt;implementation&gt;` (e.g., `cpython` or `cp`)
- `&lt;implementation&gt;@&lt;version&gt;` (e.g., `cpython@3.12`)
- `&lt;implementation&gt;&lt;version&gt;` (e.g., `cpython3.12` or `cp312`)
- `&lt;implementation&gt;&lt;version-specifier&gt;` (e.g., `cpython&gt;=3.12,&lt;3.13`)
- `&lt;implementation&gt;-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;os&gt;-&lt;arch&gt;-&lt;libc&gt;` (e.g., `cpython-3.12.3-macos-aarch64-none`)

Additionally, a specific system Python interpreter can be requested with:

- `&lt;executable-path&gt;` (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`)
- `&lt;executable-name&gt;` (e.g., `mypython3`)
- `&lt;install-dir&gt;` (e.g., `/some/environment/`)

By default, uv will automatically download Python versions if they cannot be found on the system.
This behavior can be
[disabled with the `python-downloads` option](#disabling-automatic-python-downloads).

### Python version files

The `.python-version` file can be used to create a default Python version request. uv searches for a
`.python-version` file in the working directory and each of its parents. If none is found, uv will
check the user-level configuration directory. Any of the request formats described above can be
used, though use of a version number is recommended for interoperability with other tools.

A `.python-version` file can be created in the current directory with the
[`uv python pin`](../reference/cli.md/#uv-python-pin) command.

A global `.python-version` file can be created in the user configuration directory with the
[`uv python pin --global`](../reference/cli.md/#uv-python-pin) command.

Discovery of `.python-version` files can be disabled with `--no-config`.

uv will not search for `.python-version` files beyond project or workspace boundaries (with the
exception of the user configuration directory).

## Installing a Python version

uv bundles a list of downloadable CPython and PyPy distributions for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

!!! tip

    By default, Python versions are automatically downloaded as needed without using
    `uv python install`.

To install a Python version at a specific version:

```console
$ uv python install 3.12.3
```

To install the latest patch version:

```console
$ uv python install 3.12
```

To install a version that satisfies constraints:

```console
$ uv python install '&gt;=3.8,&lt;3.10'
```

To install multiple versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.9 3.10 3.11
```

To install a specific implementation:

```console
$ uv python install pypy
```

All of the [Python version request](#requesting-a-version) formats are supported except those that
are used for requesting local interpreters such as a file path.

By default `uv python install` will verify that a managed Python version is installed or install the
latest version. If a `.python-version` file is present, uv will install the Python version listed in
the file. A project that requires multiple Python versions may define a `.python-versions` file. If
present, uv will install all of the Python versions listed in the file.

!!! important

    The available Python versions are frozen for each uv release. To install new Python versions,
    you may need upgrade uv.

### Installing Python executables

!!! important

    Support for installing Python executables is in _preview_, this means the behavior is experimental
    and subject to change.

To install Python executables into your `PATH`, provide the `--preview` option:

```console
$ uv python install 3.12 --preview
```

This will install a Python executable for the requested version into `~/.local/bin`, e.g., as
`python3.12`.

!!! tip

    If `~/.local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, you can add it with `uv tool update-shell`.

To install `python` and `python3` executables, include the `--default` option:

```console
$ uv python install 3.12 --default --preview
```

When installing Python executables, uv will only overwrite an existing executable if it is managed
by uv ‚Äî e.g., if `~/.local/bin/python3.12` exists already uv will not overwrite it without the
`--force` flag.

uv will update executables that it manages. However, it will prefer the latest patch version of each
Python minor version by default. For example:

```console
$ uv python install 3.12.7 --preview  # Adds `python3.12` to `~/.local/bin`
$ uv python install 3.12.6 --preview  # Does not update `python3.12`
$ uv python install 3.12.8 --preview  # Updates `python3.12` to point to 3.12.8
```

## Project Python versions

uv will respect Python requirements defined in `requires-python` in the `pyproject.toml` file during
project command invocations. The first Python version that is compatible with the requirement will
be used, unless a version is otherwise requested, e.g., via a `.python-version` file or the
`--python` flag.

## Viewing available Python versions

To list installed and available Python versions:

```console
$ uv python list
```

To filter the Python versions, provide a request, e.g., to show all Python 3.13 interpreters:

```console
$ uv python list 3.13
```

Or, to show all PyPy interpreters:

```console
$ uv python list pypy
```

By default, downloads for other platforms and old patch versions are hidden.

To view all versions:

```console
$ uv python list --all-versions
```

To view Python versions for other platforms:

```console
$ uv python list --all-platforms
```

To exclude downloads and only show installed Python versions:

```console
$ uv python list --only-installed
```

See the [`uv python list`](../reference/cli.md#uv-python-list) reference for more details.

## Finding a Python executable

To find a Python executable, use the `uv python find` command:

```console
$ uv python find
```

By default, this will display the path to the first available Python executable. See the
[discovery rules](#discovery-of-python-versions) for details about how executables are discovered.

This interface also supports many [request formats](#requesting-a-version), e.g., to find a Python
executable that has a version of 3.11 or newer:

```console
$ uv python find '&gt;=3.11'
```

By default, `uv python find` will include Python versions from virtual environments. If a `.venv`
directory is found in the working directory or any of the parent directories or the `VIRTUAL_ENV`
environment variable is set, it will take precedence over any Python executables on the `PATH`.

To ignore virtual environments, use the `--system` flag:

```console
$ uv python find --system
```

## Discovery of Python versions

When searching for a Python version, the following locations are checked:

- Managed Python installations in the `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`.
- A Python interpreter on the `PATH` as `python`, `python3`, or `python3.x` on macOS and Linux, or
  `python.exe` on Windows.
- On Windows, the Python interpreters in the Windows registry and Microsoft Store Python
  interpreters (see `py --list-paths`) that match the requested version.

In some cases, uv allows using a Python version from a virtual environment. In this case, the
virtual environment's interpreter will be checked for compatibility with the request before
searching for an installation as described above. See the
[pip-compatible virtual environment discovery](../pip/environments.md#discovery-of-python-environments)
documentation for details.

When performing discovery, non-executable files will be ignored. Each discovered executable is
queried for metadata to ensure it meets the [requested Python version](#requesting-a-version). If
the query fails, the executable will be skipped. If the executable satisfies the request, it is used
without inspecting additional executables.

When searching for a managed Python version, uv will prefer newer versions first. When searching for
a system Python version, uv will use the first compatible version ‚Äî not the newest version.

If a Python version cannot be found on the system, uv will check for a compatible managed Python
version download.

### Python pre-releases

Python pre-releases will not be selected by default. Python pre-releases will be used if there is no
other available installation matching the request. For example, if only a pre-release version is
available it will be used but otherwise a stable release version will be used. Similarly, if the
path to a pre-release Python executable is provided then no other Python version matches the request
and the pre-release version will be used.

If a pre-release Python version is available and matches the request, uv will not download a stable
Python version instead.

## Disabling automatic Python downloads

By default, uv will automatically download Python versions when needed.

The [`python-downloads`](../reference/settings.md#python-downloads) option can be used to disable
this behavior. By default, it is set to `automatic`; set to `manual` to only allow Python downloads
during `uv python install`.

!!! tip

    The `python-downloads` setting can be set in a
    [persistent configuration file](../configuration/files.md) to change the default behavior, or
    the `--no-python-downloads` flag can be passed to any uv command.

## Requiring or disabling managed Python versions

By default, uv will attempt to use Python versions found on the system and only download managed
Python versions when necessary. To ignore system Python versions, and only use managed Python
versions, use the `--managed-python` flag:

```console
$ uv python list --managed-python
```

Similarly, to ignore managed Python versions and only use system Python versions, use the
`--no-managed-python` flag:

```console
$ uv python list --no-managed-python
```

To change uv's default behavior in a configuration file, use the
[`python-preference` setting](#adjusting-python-version-preferences).

## Adjusting Python version preferences

The [`python-preference`](../reference/settings.md#python-preference) setting determines whether to
prefer using Python installations that are already present on the system, or those that are
downloaded and installed by uv.

By default, the `python-preference` is set to `managed` which prefers managed Python installations
over system Python installations. However, system Python installations are still preferred over
downloading a managed Python version.

The following alternative options are available:

- `only-managed`: Only use managed Python installations; never use system Python installations.
  Equivalent to `--managed-python`.
- `system`: Prefer system Python installations over managed Python installations.
- `only-system`: Only use system Python installations; never use managed Python installations.
  Equivalent to `--no-managed-python`.

!!! note

    Automatic Python version downloads can be [disabled](#disabling-automatic-python-downloads)
    without changing the preference.

## Python implementation support

uv supports the CPython, PyPy, and GraalPy Python implementations. If a Python implementation is not
supported, uv will fail to discover its interpreter.

The implementations may be requested with either the long or short name:

- CPython: `cpython`, `cp`
- PyPy: `pypy`, `pp`
- GraalPy: `graalpy`, `gp`

Implementation name requests are not case sensitive.

See the [Python version request](#requesting-a-version) documentation for more details on the
supported formats.

## Managed Python distributions

uv supports downloading and installing CPython and PyPy distributions.

### CPython distributions

As Python does not publish official distributable CPython binaries, uv instead uses pre-built
distributions from the Astral
[`python-build-standalone`](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone) project.
`python-build-standalone` is also is used in many other Python projects, like
[Rye](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye), [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/python.html), and
[bazelbuild/rules_python](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python).

The uv Python distributions are self-contained, highly-portable, and performant. While Python can be
built from source, as in tools like `pyenv`, doing so requires preinstalled system dependencies, and
creating optimized, performant builds (e.g., with PGO and LTO enabled) is very slow.

These distributions have some behavior quirks, generally as a consequence of portability; see the
[`python-build-standalone` quirks](https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/quirks.html)
documentation for details. Additionally, some platforms may not be supported (e.g., distributions
are not yet available for musl Linux on ARM).

### PyPy distributions

PyPy distributions are provided by the PyPy project.
</file>
        <file path="docs/concepts/resolution.md"># Resolution

Resolution is the process of taking a list of requirements and converting them to a list of package
versions that fulfill the requirements. Resolution requires recursively searching for compatible
versions of packages, ensuring that the requested requirements are fulfilled and that the
requirements of the requested packages are compatible.

## Dependencies

Most projects and packages have dependencies. Dependencies are other packages that are necessary in
order for the current package to work. A package defines its dependencies as _requirements_, roughly
a combination of a package name and acceptable versions. The dependencies defined by the current
project are called _direct dependencies_. The dependencies added by each dependency of the current
project are called _indirect_ or _transitive dependencies_.

!!! note

    See the [dependency specifiers
    page](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/)
    in the Python Packaging documentation for details about dependencies.

## Basic examples

To help demonstrate the resolution process, consider the following dependencies:

&lt;!-- prettier-ignore --&gt;
- The project depends on `foo` and `bar`.
- `foo` has one version, 1.0.0:
    - `foo 1.0.0` depends on `lib&gt;=1.0.0`.
- `bar` has one version, 1.0.0:
    - `bar 1.0.0` depends on `lib&gt;=2.0.0`.
- `lib` has two versions, 1.0.0 and 2.0.0. Both versions have no dependencies.

In this example, the resolver must find a set of package versions which satisfies the project
requirements. Since there is only one version of both `foo` and `bar`, those will be used. The
resolution must also include the transitive dependencies, so a version of `lib` must be chosen.
`foo 1.0.0` allows all available versions of `lib`, but `bar 1.0.0` requires `lib&gt;=2.0.0` so
`lib 2.0.0` must be used.

In some resolutions, there may be more than one valid solution. Consider the following dependencies:

&lt;!-- prettier-ignore --&gt;
- The project depends on `foo` and `bar`.
- `foo` has two versions, 1.0.0 and 2.0.0:
    - `foo 1.0.0` has no dependencies.
    - `foo 2.0.0` depends on `lib==2.0.0`.
- `bar` has two versions, 1.0.0 and 2.0.0:
    - `bar 1.0.0` has no dependencies.
    - `bar 2.0.0` depends on `lib==1.0.0`
- `lib` has two versions, 1.0.0 and 2.0.0. Both versions have no dependencies.

In this example, some version of both `foo` and `bar` must be selected; however, determining which
version requires considering the dependencies of each version of `foo` and `bar`. `foo 2.0.0` and
`bar 2.0.0` cannot be installed together as they conflict on their required version of `lib`, so the
resolver must select either `foo 1.0.0` (along with `bar 2.0.0`) or `bar 1.0.0` (along with
`foo 1.0.0`). Both are valid solutions, and different resolution algorithms may yield either result.

## Platform markers

Markers allow attaching an expression to requirements that indicate when the dependency should be
used. For example `bar ; python_version &lt; &quot;3.9&quot;` indicates that `bar` should only be installed on
Python 3.8 and earlier.

Markers are used to adjust a package's dependencies based on the current environment or platform.
For example, markers can be used to modify dependencies by operating system, CPU architecture,
Python version, Python implementation, and more.

!!! note

    See the [environment
    markers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/#environment-markers)
    section in the Python Packaging documentation for more details about markers.

Markers are important for resolution because their values change the required dependencies.
Typically, Python package resolvers use the markers of the _current_ platform to determine which
dependencies to use since the package is often being _installed_ on the current platform. However,
for _locking_ dependencies this is problematic ‚Äî the lockfile would only work for developers using
the same platform the lockfile was created on. To solve this problem, platform-independent, or
&quot;universal&quot; resolvers exist.

uv supports both [platform-specific](#platform-specific-resolution) and
[universal](#universal-resolution) resolution.

## Platform-specific resolution

By default, uv's pip interface, i.e., [`uv pip compile`](../pip/compile.md), produces a resolution
that is platform-specific, like `pip-tools`. There is no way to use platform-specific resolution in
the uv's project interface.

uv also supports resolving for specific, alternate platforms and Python versions with the
`--python-platform` and `--python-version` options. For example, if using Python 3.12 on macOS,
`uv pip compile --python-platform linux --python-version 3.10 requirements.in` can be used to
produce a resolution for Python 3.10 on Linux instead. Unlike universal resolution, during
platform-specific resolution, the provided `--python-version` is the exact python version to use,
not a lower bound.

!!! note

    Python's environment markers expose far more information about the current machine
    than can be expressed by a simple `--python-platform` argument. For example, the `platform_version` marker
    on macOS includes the time at which the kernel was built, which can (in theory) be encoded in
    package requirements. uv's resolver makes a best-effort attempt to generate a resolution that is
    compatible with any machine running on the target `--python-platform`, which should be sufficient for
    most use cases, but may lose fidelity for complex package and platform combinations.

## Universal resolution

uv's lockfile (`uv.lock`) is created with a universal resolution and is portable across platforms.
This ensures that dependencies are locked for everyone working on the project, regardless of
operating system, architecture, and Python version. The uv lockfile is created and modified by
[project](../concepts/projects/index.md) commands such as `uv lock`, `uv sync`, and `uv add`.

Universal resolution is also available in uv's pip interface, i.e.,
[`uv pip compile`](../pip/compile.md), with the `--universal` flag. The resulting requirements file
will contain markers to indicate which platform each dependency is relevant for.

During universal resolution, a package may be listed multiple times with different versions or URLs
if different versions are needed for different platforms ‚Äî the markers determine which version will
be used. A universal resolution is often more constrained than a platform-specific resolution, since
we need to take the requirements for all markers into account.

During universal resolution, all required packages must be compatible with the _entire_ range of
`requires-python` declared in the `pyproject.toml`. For example, if a project's `requires-python` is
`&gt;=3.8`, resolution will fail if all versions of given dependency require Python 3.9 or later, since
the dependency lacks a usable version for (e.g.) Python 3.8, the lower bound of the project's
supported range. In other words, the project's `requires-python` must be a subset of the
`requires-python` of all its dependencies.

When selecting the compatible version for a given dependency, uv will
([by default](#multi-version-resolution)) attempt to choose the latest compatible version for each
supported Python version. For example, if a project's `requires-python` is `&gt;=3.8`, and the latest
version of a dependency requires Python 3.9 or later, while all prior versions supporting Python
3.8, the resolver will select the latest version for users running Python 3.9 or later, and previous
versions for users running Python 3.8.

When evaluating `requires-python` ranges for dependencies, uv only considers lower bounds and
ignores upper bounds entirely. For example, `&gt;=3.8, &lt;4` is treated as `&gt;=3.8`. Respecting upper
bounds on `requires-python` often leads to formally correct but practically incorrect resolutions,
as, e.g., resolvers will backtrack to the first published version that omits the upper bound (see:
[`Requires-Python` upper limits](https://discuss.python.org/t/requires-python-upper-limits/12663)).

### Limited resolution environments

By default, the universal resolver attempts to solve for all platforms and Python versions.

If your project supports only a limited set of platforms or Python versions, you can constrain the
set of solved platforms via the `environments` setting, which accepts a list of
[PEP 508 environment markers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/#environment-markers).
In other words, you can use the `environments` setting to _reduce_ the set of supported platforms.

For example, to constrain the lockfile to macOS and Linux, and avoid solving for Windows:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
environments = [
    &quot;sys_platform == 'darwin'&quot;,
    &quot;sys_platform == 'linux'&quot;,
]
```

Or, to avoid solving for alternative Python implementations:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
environments = [
    &quot;implementation_name == 'cpython'&quot;
]
```

Entries in the `environments` setting must be disjoint (i.e., they must not overlap). For example,
`sys_platform == 'darwin'` and `sys_platform == 'linux'` are disjoint, but
`sys_platform == 'darwin'` and `python_version &gt;= '3.9'` are not, since both could be true at the
same time.

### Required environments

In the Python ecosystem, packages can be published as source distributions, built distributions
(wheels), or both; but to install a package, a built distribution is required. If a package lacks a
built distribution, or lacks a distribution for the current platform or Python version (built
distributions are often platform-specific), uv will attempt to build the package from source, then
install the resulting built distribution.

Some packages (like PyTorch) publish built distributions, but omit a source distribution. Such
packages are _only_ installable on platforms for which a built distribution is available. For
example, if a package publishes built distributions for Linux, but not macOS or Windows, then that
package will _only_ be installable on Linux.

Packages that lack source distributions cause problems for universal resolution, since there will
typically be at least one platform or Python version for which the package is not installable.

By default, uv requires each such package to include at least one wheel that is compatible with the
target Python version. The `required-environments` setting can be used to ensure that the resulting
resolution contains wheels for specific platforms, or fails if no such wheels are available. The
setting accepts a list of
[PEP 508 environment markers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/#environment-markers).

While the `environments` setting _limits_ the set of environments that uv will consider when
resolving dependencies, `required-environments` _expands_ the set of platforms that uv _must_
support when resolving dependencies.

For example, `environments = [&quot;sys_platform == 'darwin'&quot;]` would limit uv to solving for macOS (and
ignoring Linux and Windows). On the other hand,
`required-environments = [&quot;sys_platform == 'darwin'&quot;]` would _require_ that any package without a
source distribution include a wheel for macOS in order to be installable (and would fail if no such
wheel is available).

In practice, `required-environments` can be useful for declaring explicit support for non-latest
platforms, since this often requires backtracking past the latest published versions of those
packages. For example, to guarantee that any built distribution-only packages includes support for
Intel macOS:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
required-environments = [
    &quot;sys_platform == 'darwin' and platform_machine == 'x86_64'&quot;
]
```

## Dependency preferences

If resolution output file exists, i.e., a uv lockfile (`uv.lock`) or a requirements output file
(`requirements.txt`), uv will _prefer_ the dependency versions listed there. Similarly, if
installing a package into a virtual environment, uv will prefer the already installed version if
present. This means that locked or installed versions will not change unless an incompatible version
is requested or an upgrade is explicitly requested with `--upgrade`.

## Resolution strategy

By default, uv tries to use the latest version of each package. For example,
`uv pip install flask&gt;=2.0.0` will install the latest version of Flask, e.g., 3.0.0. If
`flask&gt;=2.0.0` is a dependency of the project, only `flask` 3.0.0 will be used. This is important,
for example, because running tests will not check that the project is actually compatible with its
stated lower bound of `flask` 2.0.0.

With `--resolution lowest`, uv will install the lowest possible version for all dependencies, both
direct and indirect (transitive). Alternatively, `--resolution lowest-direct` will use the lowest
compatible versions for all direct dependencies, while using the latest compatible versions for all
other dependencies. uv will always use the latest versions for build dependencies.

For example, given the following `requirements.in` file:

```python title=&quot;requirements.in&quot;
flask&gt;=2.0.0
```

Running `uv pip compile requirements.in` would produce the following `requirements.txt` file:

```python title=&quot;requirements.txt&quot;
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in
blinker==1.7.0
    # via flask
click==8.1.7
    # via flask
flask==3.0.0
itsdangerous==2.1.2
    # via flask
jinja2==3.1.2
    # via flask
markupsafe==2.1.3
    # via
    #   jinja2
    #   werkzeug
werkzeug==3.0.1
    # via flask
```

However, `uv pip compile --resolution lowest requirements.in` would instead produce:

```python title=&quot;requirements.in&quot;
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in --resolution lowest
click==7.1.2
    # via flask
flask==2.0.0
itsdangerous==2.0.0
    # via flask
jinja2==3.0.0
    # via flask
markupsafe==2.0.0
    # via jinja2
werkzeug==2.0.0
    # via flask
```

When publishing libraries, it is recommended to separately run tests with `--resolution lowest` or
`--resolution lowest-direct` in continuous integration to ensure compatibility with the declared
lower bounds.

## Pre-release handling

By default, uv will accept pre-release versions during dependency resolution in two cases:

1. If the package is a direct dependency, and its version specifiers include a pre-release specifier
   (e.g., `flask&gt;=2.0.0rc1`).
1. If _all_ published versions of a package are pre-releases.

If dependency resolution fails due to a transitive pre-release, uv will prompt use of
`--prerelease allow` to allow pre-releases for all dependencies.

Alternatively, the transitive dependency can be added as a [constraint](#dependency-constraints) or
direct dependency (i.e. in `requirements.in` or `pyproject.toml`) with a pre-release version
specifier (e.g., `flask&gt;=2.0.0rc1`) to opt-in to pre-release support for that specific dependency.

Pre-releases are
[notoriously difficult](https://pubgrub-rs-guide.netlify.app/limitations/prerelease_versions) to
model, and are a frequent source of bugs in other packaging tools. uv's pre-release handling is
_intentionally_ limited and requires user opt-in for pre-releases to ensure correctness.

For more details, see
[Pre-release compatibility](../pip/compatibility.md#pre-release-compatibility).

## Multi-version resolution

During universal resolution, a package may be listed multiple times with different versions or URLs
within the same lockfile, since different versions may be needed for different platforms or Python
versions.

The `--fork-strategy` setting can be used to control how uv trades off between (1) minimizing the
number of selected versions and (2) selecting the latest-possible version for each platform. The
former leads to greater consistency across platforms, while the latter leads to use of newer package
versions where possible.

By default (`--fork-strategy requires-python`), uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of
each package for each supported Python version, while minimizing the number of selected versions
across platforms.

For example, when resolving `numpy` with a Python requirement of `&gt;=3.8`, uv would select the
following versions:

```txt
numpy==1.24.4 ; python_version == &quot;3.8&quot;
numpy==2.0.2 ; python_version == &quot;3.9&quot;
numpy==2.2.0 ; python_version &gt;= &quot;3.10&quot;
```

This resolution reflects the fact that NumPy 2.2.0 and later require at least Python 3.10, while
earlier versions are compatible with Python 3.8 and 3.9.

Under `--fork-strategy fewest`, uv will instead minimize the number of selected versions for each
package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python
versions or platforms.

For example, when in the scenario above, uv would select `numpy==1.24.4` for all Python versions,
rather than upgrading to `numpy==2.0.2` for Python 3.9 and `numpy==2.2.0` for Python 3.10 and later.

## Dependency constraints

Like pip, uv supports constraint files (`--constraint constraints.txt`) which narrow the set of
acceptable versions for the given packages. Constraint files are similar to requirements files, but
being listed as a constraint alone will not cause a package to be included to the resolution.
Instead, constraints only take effect if a requested package is already pulled in as a direct or
transitive dependency. Constraints are useful for reducing the range of available versions for a
transitive dependency. They can also be used to keep a resolution in sync with some other set of
resolved versions, regardless of which packages are overlapping between the two.

## Dependency overrides

Dependency overrides allow bypassing unsuccessful or undesirable resolutions by overriding a
package's declared dependencies. Overrides are a useful last resort for cases in which you _know_
that a dependency is compatible with a certain version of a package, despite the metadata indicating
otherwise.

For example, if a transitive dependency declares the requirement `pydantic&gt;=1.0,&lt;2.0`, but _does_
work with `pydantic&gt;=2.0`, the user can override the declared dependency by including
`pydantic&gt;=1.0,&lt;3` in the overrides, thereby allowing the resolver to choose a newer version of
`pydantic`.

Concretely, if `pydantic&gt;=1.0,&lt;3` is included as an override, uv will ignore all declared
requirements on `pydantic`, replacing them with the override. In the above example, the
`pydantic&gt;=1.0,&lt;2.0` requirement would be ignored completely, and would instead be replaced with
`pydantic&gt;=1.0,&lt;3`.

While constraints can only _reduce_ the set of acceptable versions for a package, overrides can
_expand_ the set of acceptable versions, providing an escape hatch for erroneous upper version
bounds. As with constraints, overrides do not add a dependency on the package and only take effect
if the package is requested in a direct or transitive dependency.

In a `pyproject.toml`, use `tool.uv.override-dependencies` to define a list of overrides. In the
pip-compatible interface, the `--override` option can be used to pass files with the same format as
constraints files.

If multiple overrides are provided for the same package, they must be differentiated with
[markers](#platform-markers). If a package has a dependency with a marker, it is replaced
unconditionally when using overrides ‚Äî it does not matter if the marker evaluates to true or false.

## Dependency metadata

During resolution, uv needs to resolve the metadata for each package it encounters, in order to
determine its dependencies. This metadata is often available as a static file in the package index;
however, for packages that only provide source distributions, the metadata may not be available
upfront.

In such cases, uv has to build the package to determine its metadata (e.g., by invoking `setup.py`).
This can introduce a performance penalty during resolution. Further, it imposes the requirement that
the package can be built on all platforms, which may not be true.

For example, you may have a package that should only be built and installed on Linux, but doesn't
build successfully on macOS or Windows. While uv can construct a perfectly valid lockfile for this
scenario, doing so would require building the package, which would fail on non-Linux platforms.

The `tool.uv.dependency-metadata` table can be used to provide static metadata for such dependencies
upfront, thereby allowing uv to skip the build step and use the provided metadata instead.

For example, to provide metadata for `chumpy` upfront, include its `dependency-metadata` in the
`pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]]
name = &quot;chumpy&quot;
version = &quot;0.70&quot;
requires-dist = [&quot;numpy&gt;=1.8.1&quot;, &quot;scipy&gt;=0.13.0&quot;, &quot;six&gt;=1.11.0&quot;]
```

These declarations are intended for cases in which a package does _not_ declare static metadata
upfront, though they are also useful for packages that require disabling build isolation. In such
cases, it may be easier to declare the package metadata upfront, rather than creating a custom build
environment prior to resolving the package.

For example, you can declare the metadata for `flash-attn`, allowing uv to resolve without building
the package from source (which itself requires installing `torch`):

```toml
[project]
name = &quot;project&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;flash-attn&quot;]

[tool.uv.sources]
flash-attn = { git = &quot;https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention&quot;, tag = &quot;v2.6.3&quot; }

[[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]]
name = &quot;flash-attn&quot;
version = &quot;2.6.3&quot;
requires-dist = [&quot;torch&quot;, &quot;einops&quot;]
```

Like dependency overrides, `tool.uv.dependency-metadata` can also be used for cases in which a
package's metadata is incorrect or incomplete, or when a package is not available in the package
index. While dependency overrides allow overriding the allowed versions of a package globally,
metadata overrides allow overriding the declared metadata of a _specific package_.

!!! note

    The `version` field in `tool.uv.dependency-metadata` is optional for registry-based
    dependencies (when omitted, uv will assume the metadata applies to all versions of the package),
    but _required_ for direct URL dependencies (like Git dependencies).

Entries in the `tool.uv.dependency-metadata` table follow the
[Metadata 2.3](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/) specification,
though only `name`, `version`, `requires-dist`, `requires-python`, and `provides-extra` are read by
uv. The `version` field is also considered optional. If omitted, the metadata will be used for all
versions of the specified package.

## Lower bounds

By default, `uv add` adds lower bounds to dependencies and, when using uv to manage projects, uv
will warn if direct dependencies don't have lower bound.

Lower bounds are not critical in the &quot;happy path&quot;, but they are important for cases where there are
dependency conflicts. For example, consider a project that requires two packages and those packages
have conflicting dependencies. The resolver needs to check all combinations of all versions within
the constraints for the two packages ‚Äî if all of them conflict, an error is reported because the
dependencies are not satisfiable. If there are no lower bounds, the resolver can (and often will)
backtrack down to the oldest version of a package. This isn't only problematic because it's slow,
the old version of the package often fails to build, or the resolver can end up picking a version
that's old enough that it doesn't depend on the conflicting package, but also doesn't work with your
code.

Lower bounds are particularly critical when writing a library. It's important to declare the lowest
version for each dependency that your library works with, and to validate that the bounds are
correct ‚Äî testing with
[`--resolution lowest` or `--resolution lowest-direct`](#resolution-strategy). Otherwise, a user may
receive an old, incompatible version of one of your library's dependencies and the library will fail
with an unexpected error.

## Reproducible resolutions

uv supports an `--exclude-newer` option to limit resolution to distributions published before a
specific date, allowing reproduction of installations regardless of new package releases. The date
may be specified as an [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html) timestamp (e.g.,
`2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or a local date in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's
configured time zone.

Note the package index must support the `upload-time` field as specified in
[`PEP 700`](https://peps.python.org/pep-0700/). If the field is not present for a given
distribution, the distribution will be treated as unavailable. PyPI provides `upload-time` for all
packages.

To ensure reproducibility, messages for unsatisfiable resolutions will not mention that
distributions were excluded due to the `--exclude-newer` flag ‚Äî newer distributions will be treated
as if they do not exist.

!!! note

    The `--exclude-newer` option is only applied to packages that are read from a registry (as opposed to, e.g., Git
    dependencies). Further, when using the `uv pip` interface, uv will not downgrade previously installed packages
    unless the `--reinstall` flag is provided, in which case uv will perform a new resolution.

## Source distribution

[PEP 625](https://peps.python.org/pep-0625/) specifies that packages must distribute source
distributions as gzip tarball (`.tar.gz`) archives. Prior to this specification, other archive
formats, which need to be supported for backward compatibility, were also allowed. uv supports
reading and extracting archives in the following formats:

- gzip tarball (`.tar.gz`, `.tgz`)
- bzip2 tarball (`.tar.bz2`, `.tbz`)
- xz tarball (`.tar.xz`, `.txz`)
- zstd tarball (`.tar.zst`)
- lzip tarball (`.tar.lz`)
- lzma tarball (`.tar.lzma`)
- zip (`.zip`)

## Learn more

For more details about the internals of the resolver, see the
[resolver reference](../reference/resolver-internals.md) documentation.

## Lockfile versioning

The `uv.lock` file uses a versioned schema. The schema version is included in the `version` field of
the lockfile.

Any given version of uv can read and write lockfiles with the same schema version, but will reject
lockfiles with a greater schema version. For example, if your uv version supports schema v1,
`uv lock` will error if it encounters an existing lockfile with schema v2.

uv versions that support schema v2 _may_ be able to read lockfiles with schema v1 if the schema
update was backwards-compatible. However, this is not guaranteed, and uv may exit with an error if
it encounters a lockfile with an outdated schema version.

The schema version is considered part of the public API, and so is only bumped in minor releases, as
a breaking change (see [Versioning](../reference/policies/versioning.md)). As such, all uv patch
versions within a given minor uv release are guaranteed to have full lockfile compatibility. In
other words, lockfiles may only be rejected across minor releases.

        <file path="docs/concepts/tools.md"># Tools

Tools are Python packages that provide command-line interfaces.

!!! note

    See the [tools guide](../guides/tools.md) for an introduction to working with the tools
    interface ‚Äî this document discusses details of tool management.

## The `uv tool` interface

uv includes a dedicated interface for interacting with tools. Tools can be invoked without
installation using `uv tool run`, in which case their dependencies are installed in a temporary
virtual environment isolated from the current project.

Because it is very common to run tools without installing them, a `uvx` alias is provided for
`uv tool run` ‚Äî the two commands are exactly equivalent. For brevity, the documentation will mostly
refer to `uvx` instead of `uv tool run`.

Tools can also be installed with `uv tool install`, in which case their executables are
[available on the `PATH`](#the-path) ‚Äî an isolated virtual environment is still used, but it is not
removed when the command completes.

## Execution vs installation

In most cases, executing a tool with `uvx` is more appropriate than installing the tool. Installing
the tool is useful if you need the tool to be available to other programs on your system, e.g., if
some script you do not control requires the tool, or if you are in a Docker image and want to make
the tool available to users.

## Tool environments

When running a tool with `uvx`, a virtual environment is stored in the uv cache directory and is
treated as disposable, i.e., if you run `uv cache clean` the environment will be deleted. The
environment is only cached to reduce the overhead of repeated invocations. If the environment is
removed, a new one will be created automatically.

When installing a tool with `uv tool install`, a virtual environment is created in the uv tools
directory. The environment will not be removed unless the tool is uninstalled. If the environment is
manually deleted, the tool will fail to run.

## Tool versions

Unless a specific version is requested, `uv tool install` will install the latest available of the
requested tool. `uvx` will use the latest available version of the requested tool _on the first
invocation_. After that, `uvx` will use the cached version of the tool unless a different version is
requested, the cache is pruned, or the cache is refreshed.

For example, to run a specific version of Ruff:

```console
$ uvx ruff@0.6.0 --version
ruff 0.6.0
```

A subsequent invocation of `uvx` will use the latest, not the cached, version.

```console
$ uvx ruff --version
ruff 0.6.2
```

But, if a new version of Ruff was released, it would not be used unless the cache was refreshed.

To request the latest version of Ruff and refresh the cache, use the `@latest` suffix:

```console
$ uvx ruff@latest --version
0.6.2
```

Once a tool is installed with `uv tool install`, `uvx` will use the installed version by default.

For example, after installing an older version of Ruff:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff==0.5.0
```

The version of `ruff` and `uvx ruff` is the same:

```console
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
$ uvx ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
```

However, you can ignore the installed version by requesting the latest version explicitly, e.g.:

```console
$ uvx ruff@latest --version
0.6.2
```

Or, by using the `--isolated` flag, which will avoid refreshing the cache but ignore the installed
version:

```console
$ uvx --isolated ruff --version
0.6.2
```

`uv tool install` will also respect the `{package}@{version}` and `{package}@latest` specifiers, as
in:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff@latest
$ uv tool install ruff@0.6.0
```

## Tools directory

By default, the uv tools directory is named `tools` and is in the uv application state directory,
e.g., `~/.local/share/uv/tools`. The location may be customized with the `UV_TOOL_DIR` environment
variable.

To display the path to the tool installation directory:

```console
$ uv tool dir
```

Tool environments are placed in a directory with the same name as the tool package, e.g.,
`.../tools/&lt;name&gt;`.

!!! important

    Tool environments are _not_ intended to be mutated directly. It is strongly recommended never to
    mutate a tool environment manually, e.g., with a `pip` operation.

## Upgrading tools

Tool environments may be upgraded via `uv tool upgrade`, or re-created entirely via subsequent
`uv tool install` operations.

To upgrade all packages in a tool environment

```console
$ uv tool upgrade black
```

To upgrade a single package in a tool environment:

```console
$ uv tool upgrade black --upgrade-package click
```

Tool upgrades will respect the version constraints provided when installing the tool. For example,
`uv tool install black &gt;=23,&lt;24` followed by `uv tool upgrade black` will upgrade Black to the
latest version in the range `&gt;=23,&lt;24`.

To instead replace the version constraints, reinstall the tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install black&gt;=24
```

Similarly, tool upgrades will retain the settings provided when installing the tool. For example,
`uv tool install black --prerelease allow` followed by `uv tool upgrade black` will retain the
`--prerelease allow` setting.

!!! note

    Tool upgrades will reinstall the tool executables, even if they have not changed.

To reinstall packages during upgrade, use the `--reinstall` and `--reinstall-package` options.

To reinstall all packages in a tool environment

```console
$ uv tool upgrade black --reinstall
```

To reinstall a single package in a tool environment:

```console
$ uv tool upgrade black --reinstall-package click
```

## Including additional dependencies

Additional packages can be included during tool execution:

```console
$ uvx --with &lt;extra-package&gt; &lt;tool&gt;
```

And, during tool installation:

```console
$ uv tool install --with &lt;extra-package&gt; &lt;tool-package&gt;
```

The `--with` option can be provided multiple times to include additional packages.

The `--with` option supports package specifications, so a specific version can be requested:

```console
$ uvx --with &lt;extra-package&gt;==&lt;version&gt; &lt;tool-package&gt;
```

If the requested version conflicts with the requirements of the tool package, package resolution
will fail and the command will error.

## Tool executables

Tool executables include all console entry points, script entry points, and binary scripts provided
by a Python package. Tool executables are symlinked into the `bin` directory on Unix and copied on
Windows.

### The `bin` directory

Executables are installed into the user `bin` directory following the XDG standard, e.g.,
`~/.local/bin`. Unlike other directory schemes in uv, the XDG standard is used on _all platforms_
notably including Windows and macOS ‚Äî there is no clear alternative location to place executables on
these platforms. The installation directory is determined from the first available environment
variable:

- `$UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR`
- `$XDG_BIN_HOME`
- `$XDG_DATA_HOME/../bin`
- `$HOME/.local/bin`

Executables provided by dependencies of tool packages are not installed.

### The `PATH`

The `bin` directory must be in the `PATH` variable for tool executables to be available from the
shell. If it is not in the `PATH`, a warning will be displayed. The `uv tool update-shell` command
can be used to add the `bin` directory to the `PATH` in common shell configuration files.

### Overwriting executables

Installation of tools will not overwrite executables in the `bin` directory that were not previously
installed by uv. For example, if `pipx` has been used to install a tool, `uv tool install` will
fail. The `--force` flag can be used to override this behavior.

## Relationship to `uv run`

The invocation `uv tool run &lt;name&gt;` (or `uvx &lt;name&gt;`) is nearly equivalent to:

```console
$ uv run --no-project --with &lt;name&gt; -- &lt;name&gt;
```

However, there are a couple notable differences when using uv's tool interface:

- The `--with` option is not needed ‚Äî the required package is inferred from the command name.
- The temporary environment is cached in a dedicated location.
- The `--no-project` flag is not needed ‚Äî tools are always run isolated from the project.
- If a tool is already installed, `uv tool run` will use the installed version but `uv run` will
  not.

If the tool should not be isolated from the project, e.g., when running `pytest` or `mypy`, then
`uv run` should be used instead of `uv tool run`.

      <dir path="docs/configuration">
        <file path="docs/configuration/authentication.md"># Authentication

## Git authentication

uv allows packages to be installed from Git and supports the following schemes for authenticating
with private repositories.

Using SSH:

- `git+ssh://git@&lt;hostname&gt;/...` (e.g., `git+ssh://git@github.com/astral-sh/uv`)
- `git+ssh://git@&lt;host&gt;/...` (e.g., `git+ssh://git@github.com-key-2/astral-sh/uv`)

See the
[GitHub SSH documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh)
for more details on how to configure SSH.

Using a password or token:

- `git+https://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;token&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;/...` (e.g.,
  `git+https://git:github_pat_asdf@github.com/astral-sh/uv`)
- `git+https://&lt;token&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;/...` (e.g., `git+https://github_pat_asdf@github.com/astral-sh/uv`)
- `git+https://&lt;user&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;/...` (e.g., `git+https://git@github.com/astral-sh/uv`)

When using a GitHub personal access token, the username is arbitrary. GitHub does not support
logging in with password directly, although other hosts may. If a username is provided without
credentials, you will be prompted to enter them.

If there are no credentials present in the URL and authentication is needed, the
[Git credential helper](https://git-scm.com/doc/credential-helpers) will be queried.

## HTTP authentication

uv supports credentials over HTTP when querying package registries.

Authentication can come from the following sources, in order of precedence:

- The URL, e.g., `https://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;/...`
- A [`.netrc`](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/netrc) configuration file
- A [keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) provider (requires opt-in)

If authentication is found for a single net location (scheme, host, and port), it will be cached for
the duration of the command and used for other queries to that net location. Authentication is not
cached across invocations of uv.

`.netrc` authentication is enabled by default, and will respect the `NETRC` environment variable if
defined, falling back to `~/.netrc` if not.

To enable keyring-based authentication, pass the `--keyring-provider subprocess` command-line
argument to uv, or set `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER=subprocess`.

Authentication may be used for hosts specified in the following contexts:

- `[index]`
- `index-url`
- `extra-index-url`
- `find-links`
- `package @ https://...`

See the [index authentication documentation](./indexes.md#authentication) for details on
authenticating index URLs.

See the [`pip` compatibility guide](../pip/compatibility.md#registry-authentication) for details on
differences from `pip`.

## Authentication with alternative package indexes

See the [alternative indexes integration guide](../guides/integration/alternative-indexes.md) for
details on authentication with popular alternative Python package indexes.

## Custom CA certificates

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a
reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and
performance (especially on macOS, where reading the system trust store incurs a significant delay).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if
you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your
system's certificate store. To instruct uv to use the system's trust store, run uv with the
`--native-tls` command-line flag, or set the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable to `true`.

If a direct path to the certificate is required (e.g., in CI), set the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment
variable to the path of the certificate bundle, to instruct uv to use that file instead of the
system's trust store.

If client certificate authentication (mTLS) is desired, set the `SSL_CLIENT_CERT` environment
variable to the path of the PEM formatted file containing the certificate followed by the private
key.

Finally, if you're using a setup in which you want to trust a self-signed certificate or otherwise
disable certificate verification, you can instruct uv to allow insecure connections to dedicated
hosts via the `allow-insecure-host` configuration option. For example, adding the following to
`pyproject.toml` will allow insecure connections to `example.com`:

```toml
[tool.uv]
allow-insecure-host = [&quot;example.com&quot;]
```

`allow-insecure-host` expects to receive a hostname (e.g., `localhost`) or hostname-port pair (e.g.,
`localhost:8080`), and is only applicable to HTTPS connections, as HTTP connections are inherently
insecure.

Use `allow-insecure-host` with caution and only in trusted environments, as it can expose you to
security risks due to the lack of certificate verification.

set, uv will use this username for publishing.

### `UV_PYPY_INSTALL_MIRROR`

Managed PyPy installations are downloaded from [python.org](https://downloads.python.org/).

This variable can be set to a mirror URL to use a
different source for PyPy installations. The provided URL will replace
`https://downloads.python.org/pypy` in, e.g.,
`https://downloads.python.org/pypy/pypy3.8-v7.3.7-osx64.tar.bz2`.
Distributions can be read from a local directory by using the `file://` URL scheme.

### `UV_PYTHON`

this Python interpreter for all operations.

### `UV_PYTHON_BIN_DIR`

Specifies the directory to place links to installed, managed Python executables.

### `UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS`

Equivalent to the
[`python-downloads`](../reference/settings.md#python-downloads) setting and, when disabled, the
`--no-python-downloads` option. Whether uv should allow Python downloads.

### `UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS_JSON_URL`

Managed Python installations information is hardcoded in the `uv` binary.

This variable can be set to a URL pointing to JSON to use as a list for Python installations.
This will allow for setting each property of the Python installation, mostly the url part for offline mirror.

Note that currently, only local paths are supported.

### `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`

Specifies the directory for storing managed Python installations.

### `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR`

created by `uv venv`.

Note that `setuptools` and `wheel` are not included in Python 3.12+ environments.



## Externally defined variables

uv also reads the following externally defined environment variables:

### `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN`

Used for trusted publishing via `uv publish`. Contains the oidc request token.

### `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL`

Used for trusted publishing via `uv publish`. Contains the oidc token url.

### `ALL_PROXY`

### `APPDATA`

Path to user-level configuration directory on Windows systems.

### `BASH_VERSION`

Used to detect Bash shell usage.

### `CLICOLOR_FORCE`

Use to control color via `anstyle`.

### `COLUMNS`

Overrides terminal width used for wrapping. This variable is not read by uv directly.

This is a quasi-standard variable, described, e.g., in `ncurses(3x)`.

### `CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV`

Used to determine if an active Conda environment is the base environment or not.

### `CONDA_PREFIX`

Used to detect an activated Conda environment.

### `FISH_VERSION`

Used to detect Fish shell usage.

### `FORCE_COLOR`

Forces colored output regardless of terminal support.

See [force-color.org](https://force-color.org).

### `GITHUB_ACTIONS`

Used for trusted publishing via `uv publish`.

### `HOME`

The standard `HOME` env var.

### `HTTPS_PROXY`

Proxy for HTTPS requests.

### `HTTP_PROXY`

Proxy for HTTP requests.

### `HTTP_TIMEOUT`

Timeout (in seconds) for HTTP requests. Equivalent to `UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT`.

### `INSTALLER_NO_MODIFY_PATH`

Avoid modifying the `PATH` environment variable when installing uv using the standalone
installer and `self update` feature.

### `JPY_SESSION_NAME`

Used to detect when running inside a Jupyter notebook.

### `KSH_VERSION`

Used to detect Ksh shell usage.

### `LOCALAPPDATA`

Used to look for Microsoft Store Pythons installations.

### `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`

Used with `--python-platform macos` and related variants to set the
deployment target (i.e., the minimum supported macOS version).

Defaults to `13.0`, the least-recent non-EOL macOS version at time of writing.

### `NETRC`

Use to set the .netrc file location.

### `NO_COLOR`

Disables colored output (takes precedence over `FORCE_COLOR`).

See [no-color.org](https://no-color.org).

### `NU_VERSION`

Used to detect `NuShell` usage.

### `PAGER`

The standard `PAGER` posix env var. Used by `uv` to configure the appropriate pager.

### `PATH`

The standard `PATH` env var.

### `PROMPT`

Used to detect the use of the Windows Command Prompt (as opposed to PowerShell).

### `PWD`

The standard `PWD` posix env var.

### `PYC_INVALIDATION_MODE`

The validation modes to use when run with `--compile`.

See [`PycInvalidationMode`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/py_compile.html#py_compile.PycInvalidationMode).

### `PYTHONPATH`

Adds directories to Python module search path (e.g., `PYTHONPATH=/path/to/modules`).

### `RUST_LOG`

If set, uv will use this value as the log level for its `--verbose` output. Accepts
any filter compatible with the `tracing_subscriber` crate.

For example:

* `RUST_LOG=uv=debug` is the equivalent of adding `--verbose` to the command line
* `RUST_LOG=trace` will enable trace-level logging.

See the [tracing documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#example-syntax)
for more.

### `RUST_MIN_STACK`

Use to set the stack size used by uv.

The value is in bytes, and the default is typically 2MB (2097152).
Unlike the normal `RUST_MIN_STACK` semantics, this can affect main thread
stack size, because we actually spawn our own main2 thread to work around
the fact that Windows' real main thread is only 1MB. That thread has size
`max(RUST_MIN_STACK, 4MB)`.

### `SHELL`

The standard `SHELL` posix env var.

### `SSL_CERT_FILE`

Custom certificate bundle file path for SSL connections.

### `SSL_CLIENT_CERT`

If set, uv will use this file for mTLS authentication.
This should be a single file containing both the certificate and the private key in PEM format.

### `SYSTEMDRIVE`

Path to system-level configuration directory on Windows systems.

### `TRACING_DURATIONS_FILE`

Use to create the tracing durations file via the `tracing-durations-export` feature.

### `USERPROFILE`

Path to root directory of user's profile on Windows systems.

### `UV`

The path to the binary that was used to invoke uv.

This is propagated to all subprocesses spawned by uv.

If the executable was invoked through a symbolic link, some platforms will return the path
of the symbolic link and other platforms will return the path of the symbolic link‚Äôs target.

See &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.current_exe.html#security&gt; for security
considerations.

### `VIRTUAL_ENV`

Used to detect an activated virtual environment.

### `VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT`

If set to `1` before a virtual environment is activated, then the
virtual environment name will not be prepended to the terminal prompt.

### `XDG_BIN_HOME`

Path to directory where executables are installed.

### `XDG_CACHE_HOME`

Path to cache directory on Unix systems.

### `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`

Path to system-level configuration directory on Unix systems.

### `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`

Path to user-level configuration directory on Unix systems.

### `XDG_DATA_HOME`

Path to directory for storing managed Python installations and tools.

### `ZDOTDIR`

Used to determine which `.zshenv` to use when Zsh is being used.

### `ZSH_VERSION`

Used to detect Zsh shell usage.

</file>
        <file path="docs/configuration/files.md"># Configuration files

uv supports persistent configuration files at both the project- and user-level.

Specifically, uv will search for a `pyproject.toml` or `uv.toml` file in the current directory, or
in the nearest parent directory.

!!! note

    For `tool` commands, which operate at the user level, local configuration
    files will be ignored. Instead, uv will exclusively read from user-level configuration
    (e.g., `~/.config/uv/uv.toml`) and system-level configuration (e.g., `/etc/uv/uv.toml`).

In workspaces, uv will begin its search at the workspace root, ignoring any configuration defined in
workspace members. Since the workspace is locked as a single unit, configuration is shared across
all members.

If a `pyproject.toml` file is found, uv will read configuration from the `[tool.uv]` table. For
example, to set a persistent index URL, add the following to a `pyproject.toml`:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[[tool.uv.index]]
url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/simple&quot;
default = true
```

(If there is no such table, the `pyproject.toml` file will be ignored, and uv will continue
searching in the directory hierarchy.)

uv will also search for `uv.toml` files, which follow an identical structure, but omit the
`[tool.uv]` prefix. For example:

```toml title=&quot;uv.toml&quot;
[[index]]
url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/simple&quot;
default = true
```

!!! note

    `uv.toml` files take precedence over `pyproject.toml` files, so if both `uv.toml` and
    `pyproject.toml` files are present in a directory, configuration will be read from `uv.toml`, and
    `[tool.uv]` section in the accompanying `pyproject.toml` will be ignored.

uv will also discover user-level configuration at `~/.config/uv/uv.toml` (or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/uv/uv.toml`) on macOS and Linux, or `%APPDATA%\uv\uv.toml` on Windows; and
system-level configuration at `/etc/uv/uv.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/uv/uv.toml`) on macOS and
Linux, or `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\uv\uv.toml` on Windows.

User-and system-level configuration must use the `uv.toml` format, rather than the `pyproject.toml`
format, as a `pyproject.toml` is intended to define a Python _project_.

If project-, user-, and system-level configuration files are found, the settings will be merged,
with project-level configuration taking precedence over the user-level configuration, and user-level
configuration taking precedence over the system-level configuration. (If multiple system-level
configuration files are found, e.g., at both `/etc/uv/uv.toml` and `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/uv/uv.toml`,
only the first-discovered file will be used, with XDG taking priority.)

For example, if a string, number, or boolean is present in both the project- and user-level
configuration tables, the project-level value will be used, and the user-level value will be
ignored. If an array is present in both tables, the arrays will be concatenated, with the
project-level settings appearing earlier in the merged array.

Settings provided via environment variables take precedence over persistent configuration, and
settings provided via the command line take precedence over both.

uv accepts a `--no-config` command-line argument which, when provided, disables the discovery of any
persistent configuration.

uv also accepts a `--config-file` command-line argument, which accepts a path to a `uv.toml` to use
as the configuration file. When provided, this file will be used in place of _any_ discovered
configuration files (e.g., user-level configuration will be ignored).

## Settings

See the [settings reference](../reference/settings.md) for an enumeration of the available settings.

## `.env`

`uv run` can load environment variables from dotenv files (e.g., `.env`, `.env.local`,
`.env.development`), powered by the [`dotenvy`](https://github.com/allan2/dotenvy) crate.

To load a `.env` file from a dedicated location, set the `UV_ENV_FILE` environment variable, or pass
the `--env-file` flag to `uv run`.

For example, to load environment variables from a `.env` file in the current working directory:

```console
$ echo &quot;MY_VAR='Hello, world!'&quot; &gt; .env
$ uv run --env-file .env -- python -c 'import os; print(os.getenv(&quot;MY_VAR&quot;))'
Hello, world!
```

The `--env-file` flag can be provided multiple times, with subsequent files overriding values
defined in previous files. To provide multiple files via the `UV_ENV_FILE` environment variable,
separate the paths with a space (e.g., `UV_ENV_FILE=&quot;/path/to/file1 /path/to/file2&quot;`).

To disable dotenv loading (e.g., to override `UV_ENV_FILE` or the `--env-file` command-line
argument), set the `UV_NO_ENV_FILE` environment variable to `1`, or pass the`--no-env-file` flag to
`uv run`.

If the same variable is defined in the environment and in a `.env` file, the value from the
environment will take precedence.

## Configuring the pip interface

A dedicated [`[tool.uv.pip]`](../reference/settings.md#pip) section is provided for configuring
_just_ the `uv pip` command line interface. Settings in this section will not apply to `uv` commands
outside the `uv pip` namespace. However, many of the settings in this section have corollaries in
the top-level namespace which _do_ apply to the `uv pip` interface unless they are overridden by a
value in the `uv.pip` section.

The `uv.pip` settings are designed to adhere closely to pip's interface and are declared separately
to retain compatibility while allowing the global settings to use alternate designs (e.g.,
`--no-build`).

As an example, setting the `index-url` under `[tool.uv.pip]`, as in the following `pyproject.toml`,
would only affect the `uv pip` subcommands (e.g., `uv pip install`, but not `uv sync`, `uv lock`, or
`uv run`):

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv.pip]
index-url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/simple&quot;
```
</file>
        <file path="docs/configuration/indexes.md"># Package indexes

By default, uv uses the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org) for dependency resolution
and package installation. However, uv can be configured to use other package indexes, including
private indexes, via the `[[tool.uv.index]]` configuration option (and `--index`, the analogous
command-line option).

## Defining an index

To include an additional index when resolving dependencies, add a `[[tool.uv.index]]` entry to your
`pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
# Optional name for the index.
name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
# Required URL for the index.
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu&quot;
```

Indexes are prioritized in the order in which they‚Äôre defined, such that the first index listed in
the configuration file is the first index consulted when resolving dependencies, with indexes
provided via the command line taking precedence over those in the configuration file.

By default, uv includes the Python Package Index (PyPI) as the &quot;default&quot; index, i.e., the index used
when a package is not found on any other index. To exclude PyPI from the list of indexes, set
`default = true` on another index entry (or use the `--default-index` command-line option):

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu&quot;
default = true
```

The default index is always treated as lowest priority, regardless of its position in the list of
indexes.

Index names may only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and periods, and must be
valid ASCII.

When providing an index on the command line (with `--index` or `--default-index`) or through an
environment variable (`UV_INDEX` or `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX`), names are optional but can be included
using the `&lt;name&gt;=&lt;url&gt;` syntax, as in:

```shell
# On the command line.
$ uv lock --index pytorch=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# Via an environment variable.
$ UV_INDEX=pytorch=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu uv lock
```

## Pinning a package to an index

A package can be pinned to a specific index by specifying the index in its `tool.uv.sources` entry.
For example, to ensure that `torch` is _always_ installed from the `pytorch` index, add the
following to your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
torch = { index = &quot;pytorch&quot; }

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu&quot;
```

Similarly, to pull from a different index based on the platform, you can provide a list of sources
disambiguated by environment markers:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[project]
dependencies = [&quot;torch&quot;]

[tool.uv.sources]
torch = [
  { index = &quot;pytorch-cu118&quot;, marker = &quot;sys_platform == 'darwin'&quot;},
  { index = &quot;pytorch-cu124&quot;, marker = &quot;sys_platform != 'darwin'&quot;},
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch-cu118&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118&quot;

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch-cu124&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124&quot;
```

An index can be marked as `explicit = true` to prevent packages from being installed from that index
unless explicitly pinned to it. For example, to ensure that `torch` is installed from the `pytorch`
index, but all other packages are installed from PyPI, add the following to your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
torch = { index = &quot;pytorch&quot; }

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu&quot;
explicit = true
```

Named indexes referenced via `tool.uv.sources` must be defined within the project's `pyproject.toml`
file; indexes provided via the command-line, environment variables, or user-level configuration will
not be recognized.

If an index is marked as both `default = true` and `explicit = true`, it will be treated as an
explicit index (i.e., only usable via `tool.uv.sources`) while also removing PyPI as the default
index.

## Searching across multiple indexes

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit
resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`).

For example, if an internal index is specified via `[[tool.uv.index]]`, uv's behavior is such that
if a package exists on that internal index, it will _always_ be installed from that internal index,
and never from PyPI. The intent is to prevent &quot;dependency confusion&quot; attacks, in which an attacker
publishes a malicious package on PyPI with the same name as an internal package, thus causing the
malicious package to be installed instead of the internal package. See, for example,
[the `torchtriton` attack](https://pytorch.org/blog/compromised-nightly-dependency/) from
December 2022.

Users can opt in to alternate index behaviors via the`--index-strategy` command-line option, or the
`UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable, which supports the following values:

- `first-index` (default): Search for each package across all indexes, limiting the candidate
  versions to those present in the first index that contains the package.
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for each package across all indexes, but prefer the first index with
  a compatible version, even if newer versions are available on other indexes.
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for each package across all indexes, and select the best version from
  the combined set of candidate versions.

While `unsafe-best-match` is the closest to pip's behavior, it exposes users to the risk of
&quot;dependency confusion&quot; attacks.

## Authentication

Most private package indexes require authentication to access packages, typically via a username and
password (or access token).

!!! tip

    See the [alternative index guide](../guides/integration/alternative-indexes.md) for details on
    authenticating with specific private index providers, e.g., from AWS, Azure, or GCP.

### Providing credentials directly

Credentials can be provided directly via environment variables or by embedding them in the URL.

For example, given an index named `internal-proxy` that requires a username (`public`) and password
(`koala`), define the index (without credentials) in your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;internal-proxy&quot;
url = &quot;https://example.com/simple&quot;
```

From there, you can set the `UV_INDEX_INTERNAL_PROXY_USERNAME` and
`UV_INDEX_INTERNAL_PROXY_PASSWORD` environment variables, where `INTERNAL_PROXY` is the uppercase
version of the index name, with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by underscores:

```sh
export UV_INDEX_INTERNAL_PROXY_USERNAME=public
export UV_INDEX_INTERNAL_PROXY_PASSWORD=koala
```

By providing credentials via environment variables, you can avoid storing sensitive information in
the plaintext `pyproject.toml` file.

Alternatively, credentials can be embedded directly in the index definition:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;internal&quot;
url = &quot;https://public:koala@pypi-proxy.corp.dev/simple&quot;
```

For security purposes, credentials are _never_ stored in the `uv.lock` file; as such, uv _must_ have
access to the authenticated URL at installation time.

### Using credential providers

In addition to providing credentials directly, uv supports discovery of credentials from netrc and
keyring. See the [HTTP authentication](./authentication.md#http-authentication) documentation for
details on setting up specific credential providers.

By default, uv will attempt an unauthenticated request before querying providers. If the request
fails, uv will search for credentials. If credentials are found, an authenticated request will be
attempted.

!!! note

    If a username is set, uv will search for credentials before making an unauthenticated request.

Some indexes (e.g., GitLab) will forward unauthenticated requests to a public index, like PyPI ‚Äî
which means that uv will not search for credentials. This behavior can be changed per-index, using
the `authenticate` setting. For example, to always search for credentials:

```toml hl_lines=&quot;4&quot;
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;example&quot;
url = &quot;https://example.com/simple&quot;
authenticate = &quot;always&quot;
```

When `authenticate` is set to `always`, uv will eagerly search for credentials and error if
credentials cannot be found. If the discovered credentials are not valid (i.e., the index returns a
HTTP 401 or 403), then uv will treat packages as unavailable and query the next configured index as
described in the [index strategy](#searching-across-multiple-indexes) section.

### Disabling authentication

To prevent leaking credentials, authentication can be disabled for an index:

```toml hl_lines=&quot;4&quot;
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;example&quot;
url = &quot;https://example.com/simple&quot;
authenticate = &quot;never&quot;
```

When `authenticate` is set to `never`, uv will never search for credentials for the given index and
will error if credentials are provided directly.

## &quot;Flat&quot; indexes

By default, `[[tool.uv.index]]` entries are assumed to be PyPI-style registries that implement the
[PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) Simple Repository API. However, uv also supports &quot;flat&quot;
indexes, which are local directories or HTML pages that contain flat lists of wheels and source
distributions. In pip, such indexes are specified using the `--find-links` option.

To define a flat index in your `pyproject.toml`, use the `format = &quot;flat&quot;` option:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;example&quot;
url = &quot;/path/to/directory&quot;
format = &quot;flat&quot;
```

Flat indexes support the same feature set as Simple Repository API indexes (e.g.,
`explicit = true`); you can also pin a package to a flat index using `tool.uv.sources`.

## `--index-url` and `--extra-index-url`

In addition to the `[[tool.uv.index]]` configuration option, uv supports pip-style `--index-url` and
`--extra-index-url` command-line options for compatibility, where `--index-url` defines the default
index and `--extra-index-url` defines additional indexes.

These options can be used in conjunction with the `[[tool.uv.index]]` configuration option, and
follow the same prioritization rules:

- The default index is always treated as lowest priority, whether defined via the legacy
  `--index-url` argument, the recommended `--default-index` argument, or a `[[tool.uv.index]]` entry
  with `default = true`.
- Indexes are consulted in the order in which they‚Äôre defined, either via the legacy
  `--extra-index-url` argument, the recommended `--index` argument, or `[[tool.uv.index]]` entries.

In effect, `--index-url` and `--extra-index-url` can be thought of as unnamed `[[tool.uv.index]]`
entries, with `default = true` enabled for the former. In that context, `--index-url` maps to
`--default-index`, and `--extra-index-url` maps to `--index`.
</file>
        <file path="docs/configuration/installer.md"># Configuring the uv installer

## Changing the install path

By default, uv is installed to `~/.local/bin`. If `XDG_BIN_HOME` is set, it will be used instead.
Similarly, if `XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, the target directory will be inferred as
`XDG_DATA_HOME/../bin`.

To change the installation path, use `UV_INSTALL_DIR`:

=== &quot;macOS and Linux&quot;

    ```console
    $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | env UV_INSTALL_DIR=&quot;/custom/path&quot; sh
    ```

=== &quot;Windows&quot;

    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c {$env:UV_INSTALL_DIR = &quot;C:\Custom\Path&quot;;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex}
    ```

## Disabling shell modifications

The installer may also update your shell profiles to ensure the uv binary is on your `PATH`. To
disable this behavior, use `INSTALLER_NO_MODIFY_PATH`. For example:

```console
$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | env INSTALLER_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1 sh
```

If installed with `INSTALLER_NO_MODIFY_PATH`, subsequent operations, like `uv self update`, will not
modify your shell profiles.

## Unmanaged installations

In ephemeral environments like CI, use `UV_UNMANAGED_INSTALL` to install uv to a specific path while
preventing the installer from modifying shell profiles or environment variables:

```console
$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | env UV_UNMANAGED_INSTALL=&quot;/custom/path&quot; sh
```

The use of `UV_UNMANAGED_INSTALL` will also disable self-updates (via `uv self update`).

## Passing options to the install script

Using environment variables is recommended because they are consistent across platforms. However,
options can be passed directly to the install script. For example, to see the available options:

```console
$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh -s -- --help
```

        <file path="docs/getting-started/features.md"># Features

uv provides essential features for Python development ‚Äî from installing Python and hacking on simple
scripts to working on large projects that support multiple Python versions and platforms.

uv's interface can be broken down into sections, which are usable independently or together.

## Python versions

Installing and managing Python itself.

- `uv python install`: Install Python versions.
- `uv python list`: View available Python versions.
- `uv python find`: Find an installed Python version.
- `uv python pin`: Pin the current project to use a specific Python version.
- `uv python uninstall`: Uninstall a Python version.

See the [guide on installing Python](../guides/install-python.md) to get started.

## Scripts

Executing standalone Python scripts, e.g., `example.py`.

- `uv run`: Run a script.
- `uv add --script`: Add a dependency to a script
- `uv remove --script`: Remove a dependency from a script

See the [guide on running scripts](../guides/scripts.md) to get started.

## Projects

Creating and working on Python projects, i.e., with a `pyproject.toml`.

- `uv init`: Create a new Python project.
- `uv add`: Add a dependency to the project.
- `uv remove`: Remove a dependency from the project.
- `uv sync`: Sync the project's dependencies with the environment.
- `uv lock`: Create a lockfile for the project's dependencies.
- `uv run`: Run a command in the project environment.
- `uv tree`: View the dependency tree for the project.
- `uv build`: Build the project into distribution archives.
- `uv publish`: Publish the project to a package index.

See the [guide on projects](../guides/projects.md) to get started.

## Tools

Running and installing tools published to Python package indexes, e.g., `ruff` or `black`.

- `uvx` / `uv tool run`: Run a tool in a temporary environment.
- `uv tool install`: Install a tool user-wide.
- `uv tool uninstall`: Uninstall a tool.
- `uv tool list`: List installed tools.
- `uv tool update-shell`: Update the shell to include tool executables.

See the [guide on tools](../guides/tools.md) to get started.

## The pip interface

Manually managing environments and packages ‚Äî intended to be used in legacy workflows or cases where
the high-level commands do not provide enough control.

Creating virtual environments (replacing `venv` and `virtualenv`):

- `uv venv`: Create a new virtual environment.

See the documentation on [using environments](../pip/environments.md) for details.

Managing packages in an environment (replacing [`pip`](https://github.com/pypa/pip) and
[`pipdeptree`](https://github.com/tox-dev/pipdeptree)):

- `uv pip install`: Install packages into the current environment.
- `uv pip show`: Show details about an installed package.
- `uv pip freeze`: List installed packages and their versions.
- `uv pip check`: Check that the current environment has compatible packages.
- `uv pip list`: List installed packages.
- `uv pip uninstall`: Uninstall packages.
- `uv pip tree`: View the dependency tree for the environment.

See the documentation on [managing packages](../pip/packages.md) for details.

Locking packages in an environment (replacing [`pip-tools`](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)):

- `uv pip compile`: Compile requirements into a lockfile.
- `uv pip sync`: Sync an environment with a lockfile.

See the documentation on [locking environments](../pip/compile.md) for details.

!!! important

    These commands do not exactly implement the interfaces and behavior of the tools they are based on. The further you stray from common workflows, the more likely you are to encounter differences. Consult the [pip-compatibility guide](../pip/compatibility.md) for details.

## Utility

Managing and inspecting uv's state, such as the cache, storage directories, or performing a
self-update:

- `uv cache clean`: Remove cache entries.
- `uv cache prune`: Remove outdated cache entries.
- `uv cache dir`: Show the uv cache directory path.
- `uv tool dir`: Show the uv tool directory path.
- `uv python dir`: Show the uv installed Python versions path.
- `uv self update`: Update uv to the latest version.

## Next steps

Read the [guides](../guides/index.md) for an introduction to each feature, check out
[concept](../concepts/index.md) pages for in-depth details about uv's features, or learn how to
[get help](./help.md) if you run into any problems.
</file>
        <file path="docs/getting-started/first-steps.md"># First steps with uv

After [installing uv](./installation.md), you can check that uv is available by running the `uv`
command:

```console
$ uv
An extremely fast Python package manager.

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] &lt;COMMAND&gt;

...
```

You should see a help menu listing the available commands.

## Next steps

Now that you've confirmed uv is installed, check out an [overview of features](./features.md), learn
how to [get help](./help.md) if you run into any problems, or jump to the
[guides](../guides/index.md) to start using uv.
</file>
        <file path="docs/getting-started/help.md"># Getting help

## Help menus

The `--help` flag can be used to view the help menu for a command, e.g., for `uv`:

```console
$ uv --help
```

To view the help menu for a specific command, e.g., for `uv init`:

```console
$ uv init --help
```

When using the `--help` flag, uv displays a condensed help menu. To view a longer help menu for a
command, use `uv help`:

```console
$ uv help
```

To view the long help menu for a specific command, e.g., for `uv init`:

```console
$ uv help init
```

When using the long help menu, uv will attempt to use `less` or `more` to &quot;page&quot; the output so it is
not all displayed at once. To exit the pager, press `q`.

## Viewing the version

When seeking help, it's important to determine the version of uv that you're using ‚Äî sometimes the
problem is already solved in a newer version.

To check the installed version:

```console
$ uv version
```

The following are also valid:

```console
$ uv --version      # Same output as `uv version`
$ uv -V             # Will not include the build commit and date
$ uv pip --version  # Can be used with a subcommand
```

## Troubleshooting issues

The reference documentation contains a
[troubleshooting guide](../reference/troubleshooting/index.md) for common issues.

## Open an issue on GitHub

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues) on GitHub is a good place to report bugs
and request features. Make sure to search for similar issues first, as it is common for someone else
to encounter the same problem.

## Chat on Discord

Astral has a [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/astral-sh), which is a great place to ask
questions, learn more about uv, and engage with other community members.

## Installation methods

Install uv with our standalone installers or your package manager of choice.

### Standalone installer

uv provides a standalone installer to download and install uv:

=== &quot;macOS and Linux&quot;

    Use `curl` to download the script and execute it with `sh`:

    ```console
    $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

    ```console
    $ wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Request a specific version by including it in the URL:

    ```console
    $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.6.14/install.sh | sh
    ```

=== &quot;Windows&quot;

    Use `irm` to download the script and execute it with `iex`:

    ```console
    $ powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
    ```

    Changing the [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4#powershell-execution-policies) allows running a script from the internet.

    Request a specific version by including it in the URL:

    ```console
    $ powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.6.14/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
    ```

!!! tip

    The installation script may be inspected before use:

    === &quot;macOS and Linux&quot;

        ```console
        $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | less
        ```

    === &quot;Windows&quot;

        ```console
        $ powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | more&quot;
        ```

    Alternatively, the installer or binaries can be downloaded directly from [GitHub](#github-releases).

See the documentation on [installer configuration](../configuration/installer.md) for details on
customizing your uv installation.

### PyPI

For convenience, uv is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/).

If installing from PyPI, we recommend installing uv into an isolated environment, e.g., with `pipx`:

```console
$ pipx install uv
```

However, `pip` can also be used:

```console
$ pip install uv
```

!!! note

    uv ships with prebuilt distributions (wheels) for many platforms; if a wheel is not available for a given
    platform, uv will be built from source, which requires a Rust toolchain. See the
    [contributing setup guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#setup)
    for details on building uv from source.

### Cargo

uv is available via Cargo, but must be built from Git rather than [crates.io](https://crates.io) due
to its dependency on unpublished crates.

```console
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/astral-sh/uv uv
```

### Homebrew

uv is available in the core Homebrew packages.

```console
$ brew install uv
```

### WinGet

uv is available via [WinGet](https://winstall.app/apps/astral-sh.uv).

```console
$ winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
```

### Scoop

uv is available via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=uv).

```console
$ scoop install main/uv
```

### Docker

uv provides a Docker image at
[`ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pkgs/container/uv).

See our guide on [using uv in Docker](../guides/integration/docker.md) for more details.

### GitHub Releases

uv release artifacts can be downloaded directly from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases).

Each release page includes binaries for all supported platforms as well as instructions for using
the standalone installer via `github.com` instead of `astral.sh`.

## Upgrading uv

When uv is installed via the standalone installer, it can update itself on-demand:

```console
$ uv self update
```

!!! tip

    Updating uv will re-run the installer and can modify your shell profiles. To disable this
    behavior, set `INSTALLER_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1`.

When another installation method is used, self-updates are disabled. Use the package manager's
upgrade method instead. For example, with `pip`:

```console
$ pip install --upgrade uv
```

## Shell autocompletion

!!! tip

    You can run `echo $SHELL` to help you determine your shell.

To enable shell autocompletion for uv commands, run one of the following:

=== &quot;Bash&quot;

    ```bash
    echo 'eval &quot;$(uv generate-shell-completion bash)&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
    ```

=== &quot;Zsh&quot;

    ```bash
    echo 'eval &quot;$(uv generate-shell-completion zsh)&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
    ```

=== &quot;fish&quot;

    ```bash
    echo 'uv generate-shell-completion fish | source' &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/completions/uv.fish
    ```

=== &quot;Elvish&quot;

    ```bash
    echo 'eval (uv generate-shell-completion elvish | slurp)' &gt;&gt; ~/.elvish/rc.elv
    ```

=== &quot;PowerShell / pwsh&quot;

    ```powershell
    if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
      New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
    }
    Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(&amp; uv generate-shell-completion powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
    ```

To enable shell autocompletion for uvx, run one of the following:

=== &quot;Bash&quot;

    ```bash
    echo 'eval &quot;$(uvx --generate-shell-completion bash)&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
    ```

=== &quot;Zsh&quot;

    ```bash
    echo 'eval &quot;$(uvx --generate-shell-completion zsh)&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
    ```

=== &quot;fish&quot;

    ```bash
    echo 'uvx --generate-shell-completion fish | source' &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/completions/uvx.fish
    ```

=== &quot;Elvish&quot;

    ```bash
    echo 'eval (uvx --generate-shell-completion elvish | slurp)' &gt;&gt; ~/.elvish/rc.elv
    ```

=== &quot;PowerShell / pwsh&quot;

    ```powershell
    if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
      New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
    }
    Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(&amp; uvx --generate-shell-completion powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
    ```

Then restart the shell or source the shell config file.

## Uninstallation

If you need to remove uv from your system, follow these steps:

1.  Clean up stored data (optional):

    ```console
    $ uv cache clean
    $ rm -r &quot;$(uv python dir)&quot;
    $ rm -r &quot;$(uv tool dir)&quot;
    ```

    !!! tip

        Before removing the binaries, you may want to remove any data that uv has stored.

2.  Remove the uv and uvx binaries:

    === &quot;macOS and Linux&quot;

        ```console
        $ rm ~/.local/bin/uv ~/.local/bin/uvx
        ```

    === &quot;Windows&quot;

        ```powershell
        $ rm $HOME\.local\bin\uv.exe
        $ rm $HOME\.local\bin\uvx.exe
        ```

    !!! note

        Prior to 0.5.0, uv was installed into `~/.cargo/bin`. The binaries can be removed from there to
        uninstall. Upgrading from an older version will not automatically remove the binaries from
        `~/.cargo/bin`.

  A guide to using uv to install Python, including requesting specific versions, automatic
  installation, viewing installed versions, and more.
---

# Installing Python

If Python is already installed on your system, uv will
[detect and use](#using-existing-python-versions) it without configuration. However, uv can also
install and manage Python versions. uv [automatically installs](#automatic-python-downloads) missing
Python versions as needed ‚Äî you don't need to install Python to get started.

## Getting started

To install the latest Python version:

```console
$ uv python install
```

!!! note

    Python does not publish official distributable binaries. As such, uv uses distributions from the Astral [`python-build-standalone`](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone) project. See the [Python distributions](../concepts/python-versions.md#managed-python-distributions) documentation for more details.

Once Python is installed, it will be used by `uv` commands automatically.

!!! important

    When Python is installed by uv, it will not be available globally (i.e. via the `python` command).
    Support for this feature is in _preview_. See [Installing Python executables](../concepts/python-versions.md#installing-python-executables)
    for details.

    You can still use
    [`uv run`](../guides/scripts.md#using-different-python-versions) or
    [create and activate a virtual environment](../pip/environments.md) to use `python` directly.

## Installing a specific version

To install a specific Python version:

```console
$ uv python install 3.12
```

To install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.11 3.12
```

To install an alternative Python implementation, e.g., PyPy:

```console
$ uv python install pypy@3.10
```

See the [`python install`](../concepts/python-versions.md#installing-a-python-version) documentation
for more details.

## Reinstalling Python

To reinstall uv-managed Python versions, use `--reinstall`, e.g.:

```console
$ uv python install --reinstall
```

This will reinstall all previously installed Python versions. Improvements are constantly being
added to the Python distributions, so reinstalling may resolve bugs even if the Python version does
not change.

## Viewing Python installations

To view available and installed Python versions:

```console
$ uv python list
```

See the [`python list`](../concepts/python-versions.md#viewing-available-python-versions)
documentation for more details.

## Automatic Python downloads

Python does not need to be explicitly installed to use uv. By default, uv will automatically
download Python versions when they are required. For example, the following would download Python
3.12 if it was not installed:

```console
$ uvx python@3.12 -c &quot;print('hello world')&quot;
```

Even if a specific Python version is not requested, uv will download the latest version on demand.
For example, if there are no Python versions on your system, the following will install Python
before creating a new virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
```

!!! tip

    Automatic Python downloads can be [easily disabled](../concepts/python-versions.md#disabling-automatic-python-downloads) if you want more control over when Python is downloaded.

&lt;!-- TODO(zanieb): Restore when Python shim management is added
Note that when an automatic Python installation occurs, the `python` command will not be added to the shell. Use `uv python install-shim` to ensure the `python` shim is installed.
--&gt;

## Using existing Python versions

uv will use existing Python installations if present on your system. There is no configuration
necessary for this behavior: uv will use the system Python if it satisfies the requirements of the
command invocation. See the
[Python discovery](../concepts/python-versions.md#discovery-of-python-versions) documentation for
details.

To force uv to use the system Python, provide the `--no-managed-python` flag. See the
[Python version preference](../concepts/python-versions.md#requiring-or-disabling-managed-python-versions)
documentation for more details.

## Next steps

To learn more about `uv python`, see the [Python version concept](../concepts/python-versions.md)
page and the [command reference](../reference/cli.md#uv-python).

Or, read on to learn how to [run scripts](./scripts.md) and invoke Python with uv.

title: Building and publishing a package
description: A guide to using uv to build and publish Python packages to a package index, like PyPI.
---

# Building and publishing a package

uv supports building Python packages into source and binary distributions via `uv build` and
uploading them to a registry with `uv publish`.

## Preparing your project for packaging

Before attempting to publish your project, you'll want to make sure it's ready to be packaged for
distribution.

If your project does not include a `[build-system]` definition in the `pyproject.toml`, uv will not
build it by default. This means that your project may not be ready for distribution. Read more about
the effect of declaring a build system in the
[project concept](../concepts/projects/config.md#build-systems) documentation.

!!! note

    If you have internal packages that you do not want to be published, you can mark them as
    private:

    ```toml
    [project]
    classifiers = [&quot;Private :: Do Not Upload&quot;]
    ```

    This setting makes PyPI reject your uploaded package from publishing. It does not affect
    security or privacy settings on alternative registries.

    We also recommend only generating per-project tokens: Without a PyPI token matching the project,
    it can't be accidentally published.

## Building your package

Build your package with `uv build`:

```console
$ uv build
```

By default, `uv build` will build the project in the current directory, and place the built
artifacts in a `dist/` subdirectory.

Alternatively, `uv build &lt;SRC&gt;` will build the package in the specified directory, while
`uv build --package &lt;PACKAGE&gt;` will build the specified package within the current workspace.

!!! info

    By default, `uv build` respects `tool.uv.sources` when resolving build dependencies from the
    `build-system.requires` section of the `pyproject.toml`. When publishing a package, we recommend
    running `uv build --no-sources` to ensure that the package builds correctly when `tool.uv.sources`
    is disabled, as is the case when using other build tools, like [`pypa/build`](https://github.com/pypa/build).

## Publishing your package

Publish your package with `uv publish`:

```console
$ uv publish
```

Set a PyPI token with `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`, or set a username with `--username` or
`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and password with `--password` or `UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`. For publishing to
PyPI from GitHub Actions, you don't need to set any credentials. Instead,
[add a trusted publisher to the PyPI project](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/).

!!! note

    PyPI does not support publishing with username and password anymore, instead you need to
    generate a token. Using a token is equivalent to setting `--username __token__` and using the
    token as password.

If you're using a custom index through `[[tool.uv.index]]`, add `publish-url` and use
`uv publish --index &lt;name&gt;`. For example:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;testpypi&quot;
url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/simple/&quot;
publish-url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/legacy/&quot;
explicit = true
```

!!! note

    When using `uv publish --index &lt;name&gt;`, the `pyproject.toml` must be present, i.e., you need to
    have a checkout step in a publish CI job.

Even though `uv publish` retries failed uploads, it can happen that publishing fails in the middle,
with some files uploaded and some files still missing. With PyPI, you can retry the exact same
command, existing identical files will be ignored. With other registries, use
`--check-url &lt;index url&gt;` with the index URL (not the publish URL) the packages belong to. When
using `--index`, the index URL is used as check URL. uv will skip uploading files that are identical
to files in the registry, and it will also handle raced parallel uploads. Note that existing files
need to match exactly with those previously uploaded to the registry, this avoids accidentally
publishing source distribution and wheels with different contents for the same version.

## Installing your package

Test that the package can be installed and imported with `uv run`:

```console
$ uv run --with &lt;PACKAGE&gt; --no-project -- python -c &quot;import &lt;PACKAGE&gt;&quot;
```

The `--no-project` flag is used to avoid installing the package from your local project directory.

!!! tip

    If you have recently installed the package, you may need to include the
    `--refresh-package &lt;PACKAGE&gt;` option to avoid using a cached version of the package.

## Next steps

To learn more about publishing packages, check out the
[PyPA guides](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/section-build-and-publish/) on building
and publishing.

  A guide to using uv to create and manage Python projects, including adding dependencies, running
  commands, and building publishable distributions.
---

# Working on projects

uv supports managing Python projects, which define their dependencies in a `pyproject.toml` file.

## Creating a new project

You can create a new Python project using the `uv init` command:

```console
$ uv init hello-world
$ cd hello-world
```

Alternatively, you can initialize a project in the working directory:

```console
$ mkdir hello-world
$ cd hello-world
$ uv init
```

uv will create the following files:

```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .python-version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
```

The `main.py` file contains a simple &quot;Hello world&quot; program. Try it out with `uv run`:

```console
$ uv run main.py
Hello from hello-world!
```

## Project structure

A project consists of a few important parts that work together and allow uv to manage your project.
In addition to the files created by `uv init`, uv will create a virtual environment and `uv.lock`
file in the root of your project the first time you run a project command, i.e., `uv run`,
`uv sync`, or `uv lock`.

A complete listing would look like:

```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .venv
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pyvenv.cfg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .python-version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uv.lock
```

### `pyproject.toml`

The `pyproject.toml` contains metadata about your project:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[project]
name = &quot;hello-world&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
dependencies = []
```

You'll use this file to specify dependencies, as well as details about the project such as its
description or license. You can edit this file manually, or use commands like `uv add` and
`uv remove` to manage your project from the terminal.

!!! tip

    See the official [`pyproject.toml` guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/)
    for more details on getting started with the `pyproject.toml` format.

You'll also use this file to specify uv [configuration options](../configuration/files.md) in a
[`[tool.uv]`](../reference/settings.md) section.

### `.python-version`

The `.python-version` file contains the project's default Python version. This file tells uv which
Python version to use when creating the project's virtual environment.

### `.venv`

The `.venv` folder contains your project's virtual environment, a Python environment that is
isolated from the rest of your system. This is where uv will install your project's dependencies.

See the [project environment](../concepts/projects/layout.md#the-project-environment) documentation
for more details.

### `uv.lock`

`uv.lock` is a cross-platform lockfile that contains exact information about your project's
dependencies. Unlike the `pyproject.toml` which is used to specify the broad requirements of your
project, the lockfile contains the exact resolved versions that are installed in the project
environment. This file should be checked into version control, allowing for consistent and
reproducible installations across machines.

`uv.lock` is a human-readable TOML file but is managed by uv and should not be edited manually.

See the [lockfile](../concepts/projects/layout.md#the-lockfile) documentation for more details.

## Managing dependencies

You can add dependencies to your `pyproject.toml` with the `uv add` command. This will also update
the lockfile and project environment:

```console
$ uv add requests
```

You can also specify version constraints or alternative sources:

```console
$ # Specify a version constraint
$ uv add 'requests==2.31.0'

$ # Add a git dependency
$ uv add git+https://github.com/psf/requests
```

If you're migrating from a `requirements.txt` file, you can use `uv add` with the `-r` flag to add
all dependencies from the file:

```console
$ # Add all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
$ uv add -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt
```

To remove a package, you can use `uv remove`:

```console
$ uv remove requests
```

To upgrade a package, run `uv lock` with the `--upgrade-package` flag:

```console
$ uv lock --upgrade-package requests
```

The `--upgrade-package` flag will attempt to update the specified package to the latest compatible
version, while keeping the rest of the lockfile intact.

See the documentation on [managing dependencies](../concepts/projects/dependencies.md) for more
details.

## Running commands

`uv run` can be used to run arbitrary scripts or commands in your project environment.

Prior to every `uv run` invocation, uv will verify that the lockfile is up-to-date with the
`pyproject.toml`, and that the environment is up-to-date with the lockfile, keeping your project
in-sync without the need for manual intervention. `uv run` guarantees that your command is run in a
consistent, locked environment.

For example, to use `flask`:

```console
$ uv add flask
$ uv run -- flask run -p 3000
```

Or, to run a script:

```python title=&quot;example.py&quot;
# Require a project dependency
import flask

print(&quot;hello world&quot;)
```

```console
$ uv run example.py
```

Alternatively, you can use `uv sync` to manually update the environment then activate it before
executing a command:

=== &quot;macOS and Linux&quot;

    ```console
    $ uv sync
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ flask run -p 3000
    $ python example.py
    ```

=== &quot;Windows&quot;

    ```powershell
    uv sync
    source .venv\Scripts\activate
    flask run -p 3000
    python example.py
    ```

!!! note

    The virtual environment must be active to run scripts and commands in the project without `uv run`. Virtual environment activation differs per shell and platform.

See the documentation on [running commands and scripts](../concepts/projects/run.md) in projects for
more details.

## Building distributions

`uv build` can be used to build source distributions and binary distributions (wheel) for your
project.

By default, `uv build` will build the project in the current directory, and place the built
artifacts in a `dist/` subdirectory:

```console
$ uv build
$ ls dist/
hello-world-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
hello-world-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

See the documentation on [building projects](../concepts/projects/build.md) for more details.

title: Running scripts
description:
  A guide to using uv to run Python scripts, including support for inline dependency metadata,
  reproducible scripts, and more.
---

# Running scripts

A Python script is a file intended for standalone execution, e.g., with `python &lt;script&gt;.py`. Using
uv to execute scripts ensures that script dependencies are managed without manually managing
environments.

!!! note

    If you are not familiar with Python environments: every Python installation has an environment
    that packages can be installed in. Typically, creating [_virtual_ environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is recommended to
    isolate packages required by each script. uv automatically manages virtual environments for you
    and prefers a [declarative](#declaring-script-dependencies) approach to dependencies.

## Running a script without dependencies

If your script has no dependencies, you can execute it with `uv run`:

```python title=&quot;example.py&quot;
print(&quot;Hello world&quot;)
```

```console
$ uv run example.py
Hello world
```

&lt;!-- TODO(zanieb): Once we have a `python` shim, note you can execute it with `python` here --&gt;

Similarly, if your script depends on a module in the standard library, there's nothing more to do:

```python title=&quot;example.py&quot;
import os

print(os.path.expanduser(&quot;~&quot;))
```

```console
$ uv run example.py
/Users/astral
```

Arguments may be provided to the script:

```python title=&quot;example.py&quot;
import sys

print(&quot; &quot;.join(sys.argv[1:]))
```

```console
$ uv run example.py test
test

$ uv run example.py hello world!
hello world!
```

Additionally, your script can be read directly from stdin:

```console
$ echo 'print(&quot;hello world!&quot;)' | uv run -
```

Or, if your shell supports [here-documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document):

```bash
uv run - &lt;&lt;EOF
print(&quot;hello world!&quot;)
EOF
```

Note that if you use `uv run` in a _project_, i.e., a directory with a `pyproject.toml`, it will
install the current project before running the script. If your script does not depend on the
project, use the `--no-project` flag to skip this:

```console
$ # Note: the `--no-project` flag must be provided _before_ the script name.
$ uv run --no-project example.py
```

See the [projects guide](./projects.md) for more details on working in projects.

## Running a script with dependencies

When your script requires other packages, they must be installed into the environment that the
script runs in. uv prefers to create these environments on-demand instead of using a long-lived
virtual environment with manually managed dependencies. This requires explicit declaration of
dependencies that are required for the script. Generally, it's recommended to use a
[project](./projects.md) or [inline metadata](#declaring-script-dependencies) to declare
dependencies, but uv supports requesting dependencies per invocation as well.

For example, the following script requires `rich`.

```python title=&quot;example.py&quot;
import time
from rich.progress import track

for i in track(range(20), description=&quot;For example:&quot;):
    time.sleep(0.05)
```

If executed without specifying a dependency, this script will fail:

```console
$ uv run --no-project example.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/Users/astral/example.py&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    from rich.progress import track
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rich'
```

Request the dependency using the `--with` option:

```console
$ uv run --with rich example.py
For example: ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ 100% 0:00:01
```

Constraints can be added to the requested dependency if specific versions are needed:

```console
$ uv run --with 'rich&gt;12,&lt;13' example.py
```

Multiple dependencies can be requested by repeating with `--with` option.

Note that if `uv run` is used in a _project_, these dependencies will be included _in addition_ to
the project's dependencies. To opt-out of this behavior, use the `--no-project` flag.

## Creating a Python script

Python recently added a standard format for
[inline script metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata).
It allows for selecting Python versions and defining dependencies. Use `uv init --script` to
initialize scripts with the inline metadata:

```console
$ uv init --script example.py --python 3.12
```

## Declaring script dependencies

The inline metadata format allows the dependencies for a script to be declared in the script itself.

uv supports adding and updating inline script metadata for you. Use `uv add --script` to declare the
dependencies for the script:

```console
$ uv add --script example.py 'requests&lt;3' 'rich'
```

This will add a `script` section at the top of the script declaring the dependencies using TOML:

```python title=&quot;example.py&quot;
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   &quot;requests&lt;3&quot;,
#   &quot;rich&quot;,
# ]
# ///

import requests
from rich.pretty import pprint

resp = requests.get(&quot;https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json&quot;)
data = resp.json()
pprint([(k, v[&quot;title&quot;]) for k, v in data.items()][:10])
```

uv will automatically create an environment with the dependencies necessary to run the script, e.g.:

```console
$ uv run example.py
[
‚îÇ   ('1', 'PEP Purpose and Guidelines'),
‚îÇ   ('2', 'Procedure for Adding New Modules'),
‚îÇ   ('3', 'Guidelines for Handling Bug Reports'),
‚îÇ   ('4', 'Deprecation of Standard Modules'),
‚îÇ   ('5', 'Guidelines for Language Evolution'),
‚îÇ   ('6', 'Bug Fix Releases'),
‚îÇ   ('7', 'Style Guide for C Code'),
‚îÇ   ('8', 'Style Guide for Python Code'),
‚îÇ   ('9', 'Sample Plaintext PEP Template'),
‚îÇ   ('10', 'Voting Guidelines')
]
```

!!! important

    When using inline script metadata, even if `uv run` is [used in a _project_](../concepts/projects/run.md), the project's dependencies will be ignored. The `--no-project` flag is not required.

uv also respects Python version requirements:

```python title=&quot;example.py&quot;
# /// script
# requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;
# dependencies = []
# ///

# Use some syntax added in Python 3.12
type Point = tuple[float, float]
print(Point)
```

!!! note

    The `dependencies` field must be provided even if empty.

`uv run` will search for and use the required Python version. The Python version will download if it
is not installed ‚Äî see the documentation on [Python versions](../concepts/python-versions.md) for
more details.

## Using alternative package indexes

If you wish to use an alternative [package index](../configuration/indexes.md) to resolve
dependencies, you can provide the index with the `--index` option:

```console
$ uv add --index &quot;https://example.com/simple&quot; --script example.py 'requests&lt;3' 'rich'
```

This will include the package data in the inline metadata:

```python
# [[tool.uv.index]]
# url = &quot;https://example.com/simple&quot;
```

If you require authentication to access the package index, then please refer to the
[package index](../configuration/indexes.md) documentation.

## Locking dependencies

uv supports locking dependencies for PEP 723 scripts using the `uv.lock` file format. Unlike with
projects, scripts must be explicitly locked using `uv lock`:

```console
$ uv lock --script example.py
```

Running `uv lock --script` will create a `.lock` file adjacent to the script (e.g.,
`example.py.lock`).

Once locked, subsequent operations like `uv run --script`, `uv add --script`, `uv export --script`,
and `uv tree --script` will reuse the locked dependencies, updating the lockfile if necessary.

If no such lockfile is present, commands like `uv export --script` will still function as expected,
but will not create a lockfile.

## Improving reproducibility

In addition to locking dependencies, uv supports an `exclude-newer` field in the `tool.uv` section
of inline script metadata to limit uv to only considering distributions released before a specific
date. This is useful for improving the reproducibility of your script when run at a later point in
time.

The date must be specified as an [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html) timestamp
(e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`).

```python title=&quot;example.py&quot;
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   &quot;requests&quot;,
# ]
# [tool.uv]
# exclude-newer = &quot;2023-10-16T00:00:00Z&quot;
# ///

import requests

print(requests.__version__)
```

## Using different Python versions

uv allows arbitrary Python versions to be requested on each script invocation, for example:

```python title=&quot;example.py&quot;
import sys

print(&quot;.&quot;.join(map(str, sys.version_info[:3])))
```

```console
$ # Use the default Python version, may differ on your machine
$ uv run example.py
3.12.6
```

```console
$ # Use a specific Python version
$ uv run --python 3.10 example.py
3.10.15
```

See the [Python version request](../concepts/python-versions.md#requesting-a-version) documentation
for more details on requesting Python versions.

## Using GUI scripts

On Windows `uv` will run your script ending with `.pyw` extension using `pythonw`:

```python title=&quot;example.pyw&quot;
from tkinter import Tk, ttk

root = Tk()
root.title(&quot;uv&quot;)
frm = ttk.Frame(root, padding=10)
frm.grid()
ttk.Label(frm, text=&quot;Hello World&quot;).grid(column=0, row=0)
root.mainloop()
```

```console
PS&gt; uv run example.pyw
```

![Run Result](../assets/uv_gui_script_hello_world.png){: style=&quot;height:50px;width:150px&quot;}

Similarly, it works with dependencies as well:

```python title=&quot;example_pyqt.pyw&quot;
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QLabel, QGridLayout

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
widget = QWidget()
grid = QGridLayout()

text_label = QLabel()
text_label.setText(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
grid.addWidget(text_label)

widget.setLayout(grid)
widget.setGeometry(100, 100, 200, 50)
widget.setWindowTitle(&quot;uv&quot;)
widget.show()
sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

```console
PS&gt; uv run --with PyQt5 example_pyqt.pyw
```

![Run Result](../assets/uv_gui_script_hello_world_pyqt.png){: style=&quot;height:50px;width:150px&quot;}

title: Using tools
description:
  A guide to using uv to run tools published as Python packages, including one-off invocations with
  uvx, requesting specific tool versions, installing tools, upgrading tools, and more.
---

# Using tools

Many Python packages provide applications that can be used as tools. uv has specialized support for
easily invoking and installing tools.

## Running tools

The `uvx` command invokes a tool without installing it.

For example, to run `ruff`:

```console
$ uvx ruff
```

!!! note

    This is exactly equivalent to:

    ```console
    $ uv tool run ruff
    ```

    `uvx` is provided as an alias for convenience.

Arguments can be provided after the tool name:

```console
$ uvx pycowsay hello from uv

  -------------
&lt; hello from uv &gt;
  -------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||

```

Tools are installed into temporary, isolated environments when using `uvx`.

!!! note

    If you are running a tool in a [_project_](../concepts/projects/index.md) and the tool requires that
    your project is installed, e.g., when using `pytest` or `mypy`, you'll want to use
    [`uv run`](./projects.md#running-commands) instead of `uvx`. Otherwise, the tool will be run in
    a virtual environment that is isolated from your project.

    If your project has a flat structure, e.g., instead of using a `src` directory for modules,
    the project itself does not need to be installed and `uvx` is fine. In this case, using
    `uv run` is only beneficial if you want to pin the version of the tool in the project's
    dependencies.

## Commands with different package names

When `uvx ruff` is invoked, uv installs the `ruff` package which provides the `ruff` command.
However, sometimes the package and command names differ.

The `--from` option can be used to invoke a command from a specific package, e.g., `http` which is
provided by `httpie`:

```console
$ uvx --from httpie http
```

## Requesting specific versions

To run a tool at a specific version, use `command@&lt;version&gt;`:

```console
$ uvx ruff@0.3.0 check
```

To run a tool at the latest version, use `command@latest`:

```console
$ uvx ruff@latest check
```

The `--from` option can also be used to specify package versions, as above:

```console
$ uvx --from 'ruff==0.3.0' ruff check
```

Or, to constrain to a range of versions:

```console
$ uvx --from 'ruff&gt;0.2.0,&lt;0.3.0' ruff check
```

Note the `@` syntax cannot be used for anything other than an exact version.

## Requesting extras

The `--from` option can be used to run a tool with extras:

```console
$ uvx --from 'mypy[faster-cache,reports]' mypy --xml-report mypy_report
```

This can also be combined with version selection:

```console
$ uvx --from 'mypy[faster-cache,reports]==1.13.0' mypy --xml-report mypy_report
```

## Requesting different sources

The `--from` option can also be used to install from alternative sources.

For example, to pull from git:

```console
$ uvx --from git+https://github.com/httpie/cli httpie
```

You can also pull the latest commit from a specific named branch:

```console
$ uvx --from git+https://github.com/httpie/cli@master httpie
```

Or pull a specific tag:

```console
$ uvx --from git+https://github.com/httpie/cli@3.2.4 httpie
```

Or even a specific commit:

```console
$ uvx --from git+https://github.com/httpie/cli@2843b87 httpie
```

## Commands with plugins

Additional dependencies can be included, e.g., to include `mkdocs-material` when running `mkdocs`:

```console
$ uvx --with mkdocs-material mkdocs --help
```

## Installing tools

If a tool is used often, it is useful to install it to a persistent environment and add it to the
`PATH` instead of invoking `uvx` repeatedly.

!!! tip

    `uvx` is a convenient alias for `uv tool run`. All of the other commands for interacting with
    tools require the full `uv tool` prefix.

To install `ruff`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
```

When a tool is installed, its executables are placed in a `bin` directory in the `PATH` which allows
the tool to be run without uv. If it's not on the `PATH`, a warning will be displayed and
`uv tool update-shell` can be used to add it to the `PATH`.

After installing `ruff`, it should be available:

```console
$ ruff --version
```

Unlike `uv pip install`, installing a tool does not make its modules available in the current
environment. For example, the following command will fail:

```console
$ python -c &quot;import ruff&quot;
```

This isolation is important for reducing interactions and conflicts between dependencies of tools,
scripts, and projects.

Unlike `uvx`, `uv tool install` operates on a _package_ and will install all executables provided by
the tool.

For example, the following will install the `http`, `https`, and `httpie` executables:

```console
$ uv tool install httpie
```

Additionally, package versions can be included without `--from`:

```console
$ uv tool install 'httpie&gt;0.1.0'
```

And, similarly, for package sources:

```console
$ uv tool install git+https://github.com/httpie/cli
```

As with `uvx`, installations can include additional packages:

```console
$ uv tool install mkdocs --with mkdocs-material
```

## Upgrading tools

To upgrade a tool, use `uv tool upgrade`:

```console
$ uv tool upgrade ruff
```

Tool upgrades will respect the version constraints provided when installing the tool. For example,
`uv tool install ruff &gt;=0.3,&lt;0.4` followed by `uv tool upgrade ruff` will upgrade Ruff to the latest
version in the range `&gt;=0.3,&lt;0.4`.

To instead replace the version constraints, re-install the tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff&gt;=0.4
```

To instead upgrade all tools:

```console
$ uv tool upgrade --all
```

## Requesting Python versions

By default, uv will use your default Python interpreter (the first it finds) when when running,
installing, or upgrading tools. You can specify the Python interpreter to use with the `--python`
option.

For example, to request a specific Python version when running a tool:

```console
$ uvx --python 3.10 ruff
```

Or, when installing a tool:

```console
$ uv tool install --python 3.10 ruff
```

Or, when upgrading a tool:

```console
$ uv tool upgrade --python 3.10 ruff
```

For more details on requesting Python versions, see the
[Python version](../concepts/python-versions.md#requesting-a-version) concept page..

## Legacy Windows Scripts

Tools also support running
[legacy setuptools scripts](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#scripts).
These scripts are available via `$(uv tool dir)\&lt;tool-name&gt;\Scripts` when installed.

Currently only legacy scripts with the `.ps1`, `.cmd`, and `.bat` extensions are supported.

For example, below is an example running a Command Prompt script.

```console
$ uv tool run --from nuitka==2.6.7 nuitka.cmd --version
```

In addition, you don't need to specify the extension. `uvx` will automatically look for files ending
in `.ps1`, `.cmd`, and `.bat` in that order of execution on your behalf.

```console
$ uv tool run --from nuitka==2.6.7 nuitka --version
```

      <dir path="docs/pip">
        <file path="docs/pip/compatibility.md"># Compatibility with `pip` and `pip-tools`

uv is designed as a drop-in replacement for common `pip` and `pip-tools` workflows.

Informally, the intent is such that existing `pip` and `pip-tools` users can switch to uv without
making meaningful changes to their packaging workflows; and, in most cases, swapping out
`pip install` for `uv pip install` should &quot;just work&quot;.

However, uv is _not_ intended to be an _exact_ clone of `pip`, and the further you stray from common
`pip` workflows, the more likely you are to encounter differences in behavior. In some cases, those
differences may be known and intentional; in others, they may be the result of implementation
details; and in others, they may be bugs.

This document outlines the known differences between uv and `pip`, along with rationale,
workarounds, and a statement of intent for compatibility in the future.

## Configuration files and environment variables

uv does not read configuration files or environment variables that are specific to `pip`, like
`pip.conf` or `PIP_INDEX_URL`.

Reading configuration files and environment variables intended for other tools has a number of
drawbacks:

1. It requires bug-for-bug compatibility with the target tool, since users end up relying on bugs in
   the format, the parser, etc.
2. If the target tool _changes_ the format in some way, uv is then locked-in to changing it in
   equivalent ways.
3. If that configuration is versioned in some way, uv would need to know _which version_ of the
   target tool the user is expecting to use.
4. It prevents uv from introducing any settings or configuration that don't exist in the target
   tool, since otherwise `pip.conf` (or similar) would no longer be usable with `pip`.
5. It can lead to user confusion, since uv would be reading settings that don't actually affect its
   behavior, and many users may _not_ expect uv to read configuration files intended for other
   tools.

Instead, uv supports its own environment variables, like `UV_INDEX_URL`. uv also supports persistent
configuration in a `uv.toml` file or a `[tool.uv.pip]` section of `pyproject.toml`. For more
information, see [Configuration files](../configuration/files.md).

## Pre-release compatibility

By default, uv will accept pre-release versions during dependency resolution in two cases:

1. If the package is a direct dependency, and its version markers include a pre-release specifier
   (e.g., `flask&gt;=2.0.0rc1`).
1. If _all_ published versions of a package are pre-releases.

If dependency resolution fails due to a transitive pre-release, uv will prompt the user to re-run
with `--prerelease allow`, to allow pre-releases for all dependencies.

Alternatively, you can add the transitive dependency to your `requirements.in` file with pre-release
specifier (e.g., `flask&gt;=2.0.0rc1`) to opt in to pre-release support for that specific dependency.

In sum, uv needs to know upfront whether the resolver should accept pre-releases for a given
package. `pip`, meanwhile, _may_ respect pre-release identifiers in transitive dependencies
depending on the order in which the resolver encounters the relevant specifiers
([#1641](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1641#issuecomment-1981402429)).

Pre-releases are
[notoriously difficult](https://pubgrub-rs-guide.netlify.app/limitations/prerelease_versions) to
model, and are a frequent source of bugs in packaging tools. Even `pip`, which is viewed as a
reference implementation, has a number of open questions around pre-release handling
([#12469](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12469),
[#12470](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12470),
[#40505](https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-of-pre-releases-when-backtracking/40505/20), etc.).
uv's pre-release handling is _intentionally_ limited and _intentionally_ requires user opt-in for
pre-releases, to ensure correctness.

In the future, uv _may_ support pre-release identifiers in transitive dependencies. However, it's
likely contingent on evolution in the Python packaging specifications. The existing PEPs
[do not cover &quot;dependency resolution&quot;](https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-of-pre-releases-when-backtracking/40505/17)
and are instead focused on behavior for a _single_ version specifier. As such, there are unresolved
questions around the correct and intended behavior for pre-releases in the packaging ecosystem more
broadly.

## Packages that exist on multiple indexes

In both uv and `pip`, users can specify multiple package indexes from which to search for the
available versions of a given package. However, uv and `pip` differ in how they handle packages that
exist on multiple indexes.

For example, imagine that a company publishes an internal version of `requests` on a private index
(`--extra-index-url`), but also allows installing packages from PyPI by default. In this case, the
private `requests` would conflict with the public [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
on PyPI.

When uv searches for a package across multiple indexes, it will iterate over the indexes in order
(preferring the `--extra-index-url` over the default index), and stop searching as soon as it finds
a match. This means that if a package exists on multiple indexes, uv will limit its candidate
versions to those present in the first index that contains the package.

`pip`, meanwhile, will combine the candidate versions from all indexes, and select the best version
from the combined set, though it makes
[no guarantees around the order](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5045#issuecomment-369521345) in
which it searches indexes, and expects that packages are unique up to name and version, even across
indexes.

uv's behavior is such that if a package exists on an internal index, it should always be installed
from the internal index, and never from PyPI. The intent is to prevent &quot;dependency confusion&quot;
attacks, in which an attacker publishes a malicious package on PyPI with the same name as an
internal package, thus causing the malicious package to be installed instead of the internal
package. See, for example,
[the `torchtriton` attack](https://pytorch.org/blog/compromised-nightly-dependency/) from
December 2022.

As of v0.1.39, users can opt in to `pip`-style behavior for multiple indexes via the
`--index-strategy` command-line option, or the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable, which
supports the following values:

- `first-index` (default): Search for each package across all indexes, limiting the candidate
  versions to those present in the first index that contains the package, prioritizing the
  `--extra-index-url` indexes over the default index URL.
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for each package across all indexes, but prefer the first index with
  a compatible version, even if newer versions are available on other indexes.
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for each package across all indexes, and select the best version from
  the combined set of candidate versions.

While `unsafe-best-match` is the closest to `pip`'s behavior, it exposes users to the risk of
&quot;dependency confusion&quot; attacks.

uv also supports pinning packages to dedicated indexes (see:
[_Indexes_](../configuration/indexes.md#pinning-a-package-to-an-index)), such that a given package
is _always_ installed from a specific index.

## PEP 517 build isolation

uv uses [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) build isolation by default (akin to
`pip install --use-pep517`), following `pypa/build` and in anticipation of `pip` defaulting to PEP
517 builds in the future ([pypa/pip#9175](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9175)).

If a package fails to install due to a missing build-time dependency, try using a newer version of
the package; if the problem persists, consider filing an issue with the package maintainer,
requesting that they update the packaging setup to declare the correct PEP 517 build-time
dependencies.

As an escape hatch, you can preinstall a package's build dependencies, then run `uv pip install`
with `--no-build-isolation`, as in:

```shell
uv pip install wheel &amp;&amp; uv pip install --no-build-isolation biopython==1.77
```

For a list of packages that are known to fail under PEP 517 build isolation, see
[#2252](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2252).

## Transitive URL dependencies

While uv includes first-class support for URL dependencies (e.g., `ruff @ https://...`), it differs
from pip in its handling of _transitive_ URL dependencies in two ways.

First, uv makes the assumption that non-URL dependencies do not introduce URL dependencies into the
resolution. In other words, it assumes that dependencies fetched from a registry do not themselves
depend on URLs. If a non-URL dependency _does_ introduce a URL dependency, uv will reject the URL
dependency during resolution. (Note that PyPI does not allow published packages to depend on URL
dependencies; other registries may be more permissive.)

Second, if a constraint (`--constraint`) or override (`--override`) is defined using a direct URL
dependency, and the constrained package has a direct URL dependency of its own, uv _may_ reject that
transitive direct URL dependency during resolution, if the URL isn't referenced elsewhere in the set
of input requirements.

If uv rejects a transitive URL dependency, the best course of action is to provide the URL
dependency as a direct dependency in the relevant `pyproject.toml` or `requirement.in` file, as the
above constraints do not apply to direct dependencies.

## Virtual environments by default

`uv pip install` and `uv pip sync` are designed to work with virtual environments by default.

Specifically, uv will always install packages into the currently active virtual environment, or
search for a virtual environment named `.venv` in the current directory or any parent directory
(even if it is not activated).

This differs from `pip`, which will install packages into a global environment if no virtual
environment is active, and will not search for inactive virtual environments.

In uv, you can install into non-virtual environments by providing a path to a Python executable via
the `--python /path/to/python` option, or via the `--system` flag, which installs into the first
Python interpreter found on the `PATH`, like `pip`.

In other words, uv inverts the default, requiring explicit opt-in to installing into the system
Python, which can lead to breakages and other complications, and should only be done in limited
circumstances.

For more, see
[&quot;Using arbitrary Python environments&quot;](./environments.md#using-arbitrary-python-environments).

## Resolution strategy

For a given set of dependency specifiers, it's often the case that there is no single &quot;correct&quot; set
of packages to install. Instead, there are many valid sets of packages that satisfy the specifiers.

Neither `pip` nor uv make any guarantees about the _exact_ set of packages that will be installed;
only that the resolution will be consistent, deterministic, and compliant with the specifiers. As
such, in some cases, `pip` and uv will yield different resolutions; however, both resolutions
_should_ be equally valid.

For example, consider:

```python title=&quot;requirements.in&quot;
starlette
fastapi
```

At time of writing, the most recent `starlette` version is `0.37.2`, and the most recent `fastapi`
version is `0.110.0`. However, `fastapi==0.110.0` also depends on `starlette`, and introduces an
upper bound: `starlette&gt;=0.36.3,&lt;0.37.0`.

If a resolver prioritizes including the most recent version of `starlette`, it would need to use an
older version of `fastapi` that excludes the upper bound on `starlette`. In practice, this requires
falling back to `fastapi==0.1.17`:

```python title=&quot;requirements.txt&quot;
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in
annotated-types==0.6.0
    # via pydantic
anyio==4.3.0
    # via starlette
fastapi==0.1.17
idna==3.6
    # via anyio
pydantic==2.6.3
    # via fastapi
pydantic-core==2.16.3
    # via pydantic
sniffio==1.3.1
    # via anyio
starlette==0.37.2
    # via fastapi
typing-extensions==4.10.0
    # via
    #   pydantic
    #   pydantic-core
```

Alternatively, if a resolver prioritizes including the most recent version of `fastapi`, it would
need to use an older version of `starlette` that satisfies the upper bound. In practice, this
requires falling back to `starlette==0.36.3`:

```python title=&quot;requirements.txt&quot;
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in
annotated-types==0.6.0
    # via pydantic
anyio==4.3.0
    # via starlette
fastapi==0.110.0
idna==3.6
    # via anyio
pydantic==2.6.3
    # via fastapi
pydantic-core==2.16.3
    # via pydantic
sniffio==1.3.1
    # via anyio
starlette==0.36.3
    # via fastapi
typing-extensions==4.10.0
    # via
    #   fastapi
    #   pydantic
    #   pydantic-core
```

When uv resolutions differ from `pip` in undesirable ways, it's often a sign that the specifiers are
too loose, and that the user should consider tightening them. For example, in the case of
`starlette` and `fastapi`, the user could require `fastapi&gt;=0.110.0`.

## `pip check`

At present, `uv pip check` will surface the following diagnostics:

- A package has no `METADATA` file, or the `METADATA` file can't be parsed.
- A package has a `Requires-Python` that doesn't match the Python version of the running
  interpreter.
- A package has a dependency on a package that isn't installed.
- A package has a dependency on a package that's installed, but at an incompatible version.
- Multiple versions of a package are installed in the virtual environment.

In some cases, `uv pip check` will surface diagnostics that `pip check` does not, and vice versa.
For example, unlike `uv pip check`, `pip check` will _not_ warn when multiple versions of a package
are installed in the current environment.

## `--user` and the `user` install scheme

uv does not support the `--user` flag, which installs packages based on the `user` install scheme.
Instead, we recommend the use of virtual environments to isolate package installations.

Additionally, pip will fall back to the `user` install scheme if it detects that the user does not
have write permissions to the target directory, as is the case on some systems when installing into
the system Python. uv does not implement any such fallback.

For more, see [#2077](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2077).

## `--only-binary` enforcement

The `--only-binary` argument is used to restrict installation to pre-built binary distributions.
When `--only-binary :all:` is provided, both pip and uv will refuse to build source distributions
from PyPI and other registries.

However, when a dependency is provided as a direct URL (e.g., `uv pip install https://...`), pip
does _not_ enforce `--only-binary`, and will build source distributions for all such packages.

uv, meanwhile, _does_ enforce `--only-binary` for direct URL dependencies, with one exception: given
`uv pip install https://... --only-binary flask`, uv _will_ build the source distribution at the
given URL if it cannot infer the package name ahead of time, since uv can't determine whether the
package is &quot;allowed&quot; in such cases without building its metadata.

Both pip and uv allow editables requirements to be built and installed even when `--only-binary` is
provided. For example, `uv pip install -e . --only-binary :all:` is allowed.

## `--no-binary` enforcement

The `--no-binary` argument is used to restrict installation to source distributions. When
`--no-binary` is provided, uv will refuse to install pre-built binary distributions, but _will_
reuse any binary distributions that are already present in the local cache.

Additionally, and in contrast to pip, uv's resolver will still read metadata from pre-built binary
distributions when `--no-binary` is provided.

## `manylinux_compatible` enforcement

[PEP 600](https://peps.python.org/pep-0600/#package-installers) describes a mechanism through which
Python distributors can opt out of `manylinux` compatibility by defining a `manylinux_compatible`
function on the `_manylinux` standard library module.

uv respects `manylinux_compatible`, but only tests against the current glibc version, and applies
the return value of `manylinux_compatible` globally.

In other words, if `manylinux_compatible` returns `True`, uv will treat the system as
`manylinux`-compatible; if it returns `False`, uv will treat the system as `manylinux`-incompatible,
without calling `manylinux_compatible` for every glibc version.

This approach is not a complete implementation of the spec, but is compatible with common blanket
`manylinux_compatible` implementations like
[`no-manylinux`](https://pypi.org/project/no-manylinux/):

```python
from __future__ import annotations
manylinux1_compatible = False
manylinux2010_compatible = False
manylinux2014_compatible = False


def manylinux_compatible(*_, **__):  # PEP 600
    return False
```

## Bytecode compilation

Unlike `pip`, uv does not compile `.py` files to `.pyc` files during installation by default (i.e.,
uv does not create or populate `__pycache__` directories). To enable bytecode compilation during
installs, pass the `--compile-bytecode` flag to `uv pip install` or `uv pip sync`, or set the
`UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE` environment variable to `1`.

Skipping bytecode compilation can be undesirable in workflows; for example, we recommend enabling
bytecode compilation in [Docker builds](../guides/integration/docker.md) to improve startup times
(at the cost of increased build times).

As bytecode compilation suppresses various warnings issued by the Python interpreter, in rare cases
you may seen `SyntaxWarning` or `DeprecationWarning` messages when running Python code that was
installed with uv that do not appear when using `pip`. These are valid warnings, but are typically
hidden by the bytecode compilation process, and can either be ignored, fixed upstream, or similarly
suppressed by enabling bytecode compilation in uv.

## Strictness and spec enforcement

uv tends to be stricter than `pip`, and will often reject packages that `pip` would install. For
example, uv rejects HTML indexes with invalid URL fragments (see:
[PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)), while `pip` will ignore such fragments.

In some cases, uv implements lenient behavior for popular packages that are known to have specific
spec compliance issues.

If uv rejects a package that `pip` would install due to a spec violation, the best course of action
is to first attempt to install a newer version of the package; and, if that fails, to report the
issue to the package maintainer.

## `pip` command-line options and subcommands

uv does not support the complete set of `pip`'s command-line options and subcommands, although it
does support a large subset.

Missing options and subcommands are prioritized based on user demand and the complexity of the
implementation, and tend to be tracked in individual issues. For example:

- [`--trusted-host`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1339)
- [`--user`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2077)

If you encounter a missing option or subcommand, please search the issue tracker to see if it has
already been reported, and if not, consider opening a new issue. Feel free to upvote any existing
issues to convey your interest.

## Registry authentication

uv does not support `pip`'s `auto` or `import` options for `--keyring-provider`. At present, only
the `subprocess` option is supported.

Unlike `pip`, uv does not enable keyring authentication by default.

Unlike `pip`, uv does not wait until a request returns a HTTP 401 before searching for
authentication. uv attaches authentication to all requests for hosts with credentials available.

## `egg` support

uv does not support features that are considered legacy or deprecated in `pip`. For example, uv does
not support `.egg`-style distributions.

However, uv does have partial support for (1) `.egg-info`-style distributions (which are
occasionally found in Docker images and Conda environments) and (2) legacy editable
`.egg-link`-style distributions.

Specifically, uv does not support installing new `.egg-info`- or `.egg-link`-style distributions,
but will respect any such existing distributions during resolution, list them with `uv pip list` and
`uv pip freeze`, and uninstall them with `uv pip uninstall`.

## Build constraints

When constraints are provided via `--constraint` (or `UV_CONSTRAINT`), uv will _not_ apply the
constraints when resolving build dependencies (i.e., to build a source distribution). Instead, build
constraints should be provided via the dedicated `--build-constraint` (or `UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT`)
setting.

pip, meanwhile, applies constraints to build dependencies when specified via `PIP_CONSTRAINT`, but
not when provided via `--constraint` on the command line.

For example, to ensure that `setuptools 60.0.0` is used to build any packages with a build
dependency on `setuptools`, use `--build-constraint`, rather than `--constraint`.

## `pip compile` defaults

There are a few small but notable differences in the default behaviors of `pip compile` and
`pip-tools`.

By default, uv does not write the compiled requirements to an output file. Instead, uv requires that
the user specify an output file explicitly with the `-o` or `--output-file` option.

By default, uv strips extras when outputting the compiled requirements. In other words, uv defaults
to `--strip-extras`, while `pip-compile` defaults to `--no-strip-extras`. `pip-compile` is scheduled
to change this default in the next major release (v8.0.0), at which point both tools will default to
`--strip-extras`. To retain extras with uv, pass the `--no-strip-extras` flag to `uv pip compile`.

By default, uv does not write any index URLs to the output file, while `pip-compile` outputs any
`--index-url` or `--extra-index-url` that does not match the default (PyPI). To include index URLs
in the output file, pass the `--emit-index-url` flag to `uv pip compile`. Unlike `pip-compile`, uv
will include all index URLs when `--emit-index-url` is passed, including the default index URL.

## `requires-python` enforcement

When evaluating `requires-python` ranges for dependencies, uv only considers lower bounds and
ignores upper bounds entirely. For example, `&gt;=3.8, &lt;4` is treated as `&gt;=3.8`. Respecting upper
bounds on `requires-python` often leads to formally correct but practically incorrect resolutions,
as, e.g., resolvers will backtrack to the first published version that omits the upper bound (see:
[`Requires-Python` upper limits](https://discuss.python.org/t/requires-python-upper-limits/12663)).

When evaluating Python versions against `requires-python` specifiers, uv truncates the candidate
version to the major, minor, and patch components, ignoring (e.g.) pre-release and post-release
identifiers.

For example, a project that declares `requires-python: &gt;=3.13` will accept Python 3.13.0b1. While
3.13.0b1 is not strictly greater than 3.13, it is greater than 3.13 when the pre-release identifier
is omitted.

While this is not strictly compliant with [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/), it _is_
consistent with
[pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/24.1.1/src/pip/_internal/resolution/resolvelib/candidates.py#L540).

## Package priority

There are usually many possible solutions given a set of requirements, and a resolver must choose
between them. uv's resolver and pip's resolver have a different set of package priorities. While
both resolvers use the user-provided order as one of their priorities, pip has additional
[priorities](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/more-dependency-resolution/#the-resolver-algorithm)
that uv does not have. Hence, uv is more likely to be affected by a change in user order than pip
is.

For example, `uv pip install foo bar` prioritizes newer versions of `foo` over `bar` and could
result in a different resolution than `uv pip install bar foo`. Similarly, this behavior applies to
the ordering of requirements in input files for `uv pip compile`.
</file>
        <file path="docs/pip/compile.md"># Locking environments

Locking is to take a dependency, e.g., `ruff`, and write an exact version to use to a file. When
working with many dependencies, it is useful to lock the exact versions so the environment can be
reproduced. Without locking, the versions of dependencies could change over time, when using a
different tool, or across platforms.

## Locking requirements

uv allows dependencies to be locked in the `requirements.txt` format. It is recommended to use the
standard `pyproject.toml` to define dependencies, but other dependency formats are supported as
well. See the documentation on [declaring dependencies](dependencies.md) for more details on how to
define dependencies.

To lock dependencies declared in a `pyproject.toml`:

```console
$ uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
```

Note by default the `uv pip compile` output is just displayed and `--output-file` / `-o` argument is
needed to write to a file.

To lock dependencies declared in a `requirements.in`:

```console
$ uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
```

To lock dependencies declared in multiple files:

```console
$ uv pip compile pyproject.toml requirements-dev.in -o requirements-dev.txt
```

uv also supports legacy `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` formats. To lock dependencies declared in a
`setup.py`:

```console
$ uv pip compile setup.py -o requirements.txt
```

To lock dependencies from stdin, use `-`:

```console
$ echo &quot;ruff&quot; | uv pip compile -
```

To lock with optional dependencies enabled, e.g., the &quot;foo&quot; extra:

```console
$ uv pip compile pyproject.toml --extra foo
```

To lock with all optional dependencies enabled:

```console
$ uv pip compile pyproject.toml --all-extras
```

Note extras are not supported with the `requirements.in` format.

To lock a dependency group in the current project directory's `pyproject.toml`, for example the
group `foo`:

```console
$ uv pip compile --group foo
```

!!! important

    A `--group` flag has to be added to pip-tools' `pip compile`, [although they're considering it](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/2062). We expect to support whatever syntax and semantics they adopt.

To specify the project directory where groups should be sourced from:

```console
$ uv pip compile --project some/path/ --group foo --group bar
```

Alternatively, you can specify a path to a `pyproject.toml` for each group:

```console
$ uv pip compile --group some/path/pyproject.toml:foo --group other/pyproject.toml:bar
```

!!! note

    `--group` flags do not apply to other specified sources. For instance,
    `uv pip compile some/path/pyproject.toml --group foo` sources `foo`
    from `./pyproject.toml` and **not** `some/path/pyproject.toml`.

## Upgrading requirements

When using an output file, uv will consider the versions pinned in an existing output file. If a
dependency is pinned it will not be upgraded on a subsequent compile run. For example:

```console
$ echo &quot;ruff==0.3.0&quot; &gt; requirements.txt
$ echo &quot;ruff&quot; | uv pip compile - -o requirements.txt
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile - -o requirements.txt
ruff==0.3.0
```

To upgrade a dependency, use the `--upgrade-package` flag:

```console
$ uv pip compile - -o requirements.txt --upgrade-package ruff
```

To upgrade all dependencies, there is an `--upgrade` flag.

## Syncing an environment

Dependencies can be installed directly from their definition files or from compiled
`requirements.txt` files with `uv pip install`. See the documentation on
[installing packages from files](packages.md#installing-packages-from-files) for more details.

When installing with `uv pip install`, packages that are already installed will not be removed
unless they conflict with the lockfile. This means that the environment can have dependencies that
aren't declared in the lockfile, which isn't great for reproducibility. To ensure the environment
exactly matches the lockfile, use `uv pip sync` instead.

To sync an environment with a `requirements.txt` file:

```console
$ uv pip sync requirements.txt
```

To sync an environment with a `pyproject.toml` file:

```console
$ uv pip sync pyproject.toml
```

## Adding constraints

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement
that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the
installation of that package. Constraints can be used to add bounds to dependencies that are not
dependencies of the current project.

To define a constraint, define a bound for a package:

```python title=&quot;constraints.txt&quot;
pydantic&lt;2.0
```

To use a constraints file:

```console
$ uv pip compile requirements.in --constraint constraints.txt
```

Note that multiple constraints can be defined in each file and multiple files can be used.

uv will also read `constraint-dependencies` from the `pyproject.toml` at the workspace root, and
append them to those specified in the constraints file.

## Adding build constraints

Similar to `constraints`, but specifically for build-time dependencies, including those required
when building runtime dependencies.

Build constraint files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a
build-time requirement. However, including a package in a build constraints file will _not_ trigger
its installation at build time; instead, constraints apply only when the package is required as a
direct or transitive build-time dependency. Build constraints can be used to add bounds to
dependencies that are not explicitly declared as build-time dependencies of the current project.

For example, if a package defines its build dependencies as follows:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[build-system]
requires = [&quot;setuptools&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;setuptools.build_meta&quot;
```

Build constraints could be used to ensure that a specific version of `setuptools` is used for every
package in the workspace:

```python title=&quot;build-constraints.txt&quot;
setuptools==75.0.0
```

uv will also read `build-constraint-dependencies` from the `pyproject.toml` at the workspace root,
and append them to those specified in the build constraints file.

## Overriding dependency versions

Overrides files are `requirements.txt`-like files that force a specific version of a requirement to
be installed, regardless of the requirements declared by any constituent package, and regardless of
whether this would be considered an invalid resolution.

While constraints are _additive_, in that they're combined with the requirements of the constituent
packages, overrides are _absolute_, in that they completely replace the requirements of the
constituent packages.

Overrides are most often used to remove upper bounds from a transitive dependency. For example, if
`a` requires `c&gt;=1.0,&lt;2.0` and `b` requires `c&gt;=2.0` and the current project requires `a` and `b`
then the dependencies cannot be resolved.

To define an override, define the new requirement for the problematic package:

```python title=&quot;overrides.txt&quot;
c&gt;=2.0
```

To use an overrides file:

```console
$ uv pip compile requirements.in --override overrides.txt
```

Now, resolution can succeed. However, note that if `a` is _correct_ that it does not support
`c&gt;=2.0` then a runtime error will likely be encountered when using the packages.

Note that multiple overrides can be defined in each file and multiple files can be used.
</file>
        <file path="docs/pip/dependencies.md"># Declaring dependencies

It is best practice to declare dependencies in a static file instead of modifying environments with
ad-hoc installations. Once dependencies are defined, they can be [locked](./compile.md) to create a
consistent, reproducible environment.

## Using `pyproject.toml`

The `pyproject.toml` file is the Python standard for defining configuration for a project.

To define project dependencies in a `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[project]
dependencies = [
  &quot;httpx&quot;,
  &quot;ruff&gt;=0.3.0&quot;
]
```

To define optional dependencies in a `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[project.optional-dependencies]
cli = [
  &quot;rich&quot;,
  &quot;click&quot;,
]
```

Each of the keys defines an &quot;extra&quot;, which can be installed using the `--extra` and `--all-extras`
flags or `package[&lt;extra&gt;]` syntax. See the documentation on
[installing packages](./packages.md#installing-packages-from-files) for more details.

See the official
[`pyproject.toml` guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/) for
more details on getting started with a `pyproject.toml`.

## Using `requirements.in`

It is also common to use a lightweight `requirements.txt` format to declare the dependencies for the
project. Each requirement is defined on its own line. Commonly, this file is called
`requirements.in` to distinguish it from `requirements.txt` which is used for the locked
dependencies.

To define dependencies in a `requirements.in` file:

```python title=&quot;requirements.in&quot;
httpx
ruff&gt;=0.3.0
```

Optional dependencies groups are not supported in this format.
</file>
        <file path="docs/pip/environments.md"># Using Python environments

Each Python installation has an environment that is active when Python is used. Packages can be
installed into an environment to make their modules available from your Python scripts. Generally,
it is considered best practice not to modify a Python installation's environment. This is especially
important for Python installations that come with the operating system which often manage the
packages themselves. A virtual environment is a lightweight way to isolate packages from a Python
installation's environment. Unlike `pip`, uv requires using a virtual environment by default.

## Creating a virtual environment

uv supports creating virtual environments, e.g., to create a virtual environment at `.venv`:

```console
$ uv venv
```

A specific name or path can be specified, e.g., to create a virtual environment at `my-name`:

```console
$ uv venv my-name
```

A Python version can be requested, e.g., to create a virtual environment with Python 3.11:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.11
```

Note this requires the requested Python version to be available on the system. However, if
unavailable, uv will download Python for you. See the
[Python version](../concepts/python-versions.md) documentation for more details.

## Using a virtual environment

When using the default virtual environment name, uv will automatically find and use the virtual
environment during subsequent invocations.

```console
$ uv venv

$ # Install a package in the new virtual environment
$ uv pip install ruff
```

The virtual environment can be &quot;activated&quot; to make its packages available:

=== &quot;macOS and Linux&quot;

    ```console
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

=== &quot;Windows&quot;

    ```console
    $ .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

!!! note

    The default activation script on Unix is for POSIX compliant shells like `sh`, `bash`, or `zsh`.
    There are additional activation scripts for common alternative shells.

    === &quot;fish&quot;

        ```console
        $ source .venv/bin/activate.fish
        ```

    === &quot;csh / tcsh&quot;


        ```console
        $ source .venv/bin/activate.csh
        ```

    === &quot;Nushell&quot;

        ```console
        $ use .venv\Scripts\activate.nu
        ```

## Deactivating an environment

To exit a virtual environment, use the `deactivate` command:

```console
$ deactivate
```

## Using arbitrary Python environments

Since uv has no dependency on Python, it can install into virtual environments other than its own.
For example, setting `VIRTUAL_ENV=/path/to/venv` will cause uv to install into `/path/to/venv`,
regardless of where uv is installed. Note that if `VIRTUAL_ENV` is set to a directory that is
**not** a [PEP 405 compliant](https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/#specification) virtual environment,
it will be ignored.

uv can also install into arbitrary, even non-virtual environments, with the `--python` argument
provided to `uv pip sync` or `uv pip install`. For example,
`uv pip install --python /path/to/python` will install into the environment linked to the
`/path/to/python` interpreter.

For convenience, `uv pip install --system` will install into the system Python environment. Using
`--system` is roughly equivalent to `uv pip install --python $(which python)`, but note that
executables that are linked to virtual environments will be skipped. Although we generally recommend
using virtual environments for dependency management, `--system` is appropriate in continuous
integration and containerized environments.

The `--system` flag is also used to opt in to mutating system environments. For example, the
`--python` argument can be used to request a Python version (e.g., `--python 3.12`), and uv will
search for an interpreter that meets the request. If uv finds a system interpreter (e.g.,
`/usr/lib/python3.12`), then the `--system` flag is required to allow modification of this
non-virtual Python environment. Without the `--system` flag, uv will ignore any interpreters that
are not in virtual environments. Conversely, when the `--system` flag is provided, uv will ignore
any interpreters that _are_ in virtual environments.

Installing into system Python across platforms and distributions is notoriously difficult. uv
supports the common cases, but will not work in all cases. For example, installing into system
Python on Debian prior to Python 3.10 is unsupported due to the
[distribution's patching of `distutils` (but not `sysconfig`)](https://ffy00.github.io/blog/02-python-debian-and-the-install-locations/).
While we always recommend the use of virtual environments, uv considers them to be required in these
non-standard environments.

If uv is installed in a Python environment, e.g., with `pip`, it can still be used to modify other
environments. However, when invoked with `python -m uv`, uv will default to using the parent
interpreter's environment. Invoking uv via Python adds startup overhead and is not recommended for
general usage.

uv itself does not depend on Python, but it does need to locate a Python environment to (1) install
dependencies into the environment and (2) build source distributions.

## Discovery of Python environments

When running a command that mutates an environment such as `uv pip sync` or `uv pip install`, uv
will search for a virtual environment in the following order:

- An activated virtual environment based on the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable.
- An activated Conda environment based on the `CONDA_PREFIX` environment variable.
- A virtual environment at `.venv` in the current directory, or in the nearest parent directory.

If no virtual environment is found, uv will prompt the user to create one in the current directory
via `uv venv`.

If the `--system` flag is included, uv will skip virtual environments search for an installed Python
version. Similarly, when running a command that does not mutate the environment such as
`uv pip compile`, uv does not _require_ a virtual environment ‚Äî however, a Python interpreter is
still required. See the documentation on
[Python discovery](../concepts/python-versions.md#discovery-of-python-versions) for details on the
discovery of installed Python versions.

## Listing installed packages

To list all of the packages in the environment:

```console
$ uv pip list
```

To list the packages in a JSON format:

```console
$ uv pip list --format json
```

To list all of the packages in the environment in a `requirements.txt` format:

```console
$ uv pip freeze
```

## Inspecting a package

To show information about an installed package, e.g., `numpy`:

```console
$ uv pip show numpy
```

Multiple packages can be inspected at once.

## Verifying an environment

It is possible to install packages with conflicting requirements into an environment if installed in
multiple steps.

To check for conflicts or missing dependencies in the environment:

```console
$ uv pip check
```
</file>
        <file path="docs/pip/packages.md"># Managing packages

## Installing a package

To install a package into the virtual environment, e.g., Flask:

```console
$ uv pip install flask
```

To install a package with optional dependencies enabled, e.g., Flask with the &quot;dotenv&quot; extra:

```console
$ uv pip install &quot;flask[dotenv]&quot;
```

To install multiple packages, e.g., Flask and Ruff:

```console
$ uv pip install flask ruff
```

To install a package with a constraint, e.g., Ruff v0.2.0 or newer:

```console
$ uv pip install 'ruff&gt;=0.2.0'
```

To install a package at a specific version, e.g., Ruff v0.3.0:

```console
$ uv pip install 'ruff==0.3.0'
```

To install a package from the disk:

```console
$ uv pip install &quot;ruff @ ./projects/ruff&quot;
```

To install a package from GitHub:

```console
$ uv pip install &quot;git+https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff&quot;
```

To install a package from GitHub at a specific reference:

```console
$ # Install a tag
$ uv pip install &quot;git+https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff@v0.2.0&quot;

$ # Install a commit
$ uv pip install &quot;git+https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff@1fadefa67b26508cc59cf38e6130bde2243c929d&quot;

$ # Install a branch
$ uv pip install &quot;git+https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff@main&quot;
```

See the [Git authentication](../configuration/authentication.md#git-authentication) documentation
for installation from a private repository.

## Editable packages

Editable packages do not need to be reinstalled for changes to their source code to be active.

To install the current project as an editable package

```console
$ uv pip install -e .
```

To install a project in another directory as an editable package:

```console
$ uv pip install -e &quot;ruff @ ./project/ruff&quot;
```

## Installing packages from files

Multiple packages can be installed at once from standard file formats.

Install from a `requirements.txt` file:

```console
$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

See the [`uv pip compile`](./compile.md) documentation for more information on `requirements.txt`
files.

Install from a `pyproject.toml` file:

```console
$ uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

Install from a `pyproject.toml` file with optional dependencies enabled, e.g., the &quot;foo&quot; extra:

```console
$ uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --extra foo
```

Install from a `pyproject.toml` file with all optional dependencies enabled:

```console
$ uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --all-extras
```

To install dependency groups in the current project directory's `pyproject.toml`, for example the
group `foo`:

```console
$ uv pip install --group foo
```

To specify the project directory where groups should be sourced from:

```console
$ uv pip install --project some/path/ --group foo --group bar
```

Alternatively, you can specify a path to a `pyproject.toml` for each group:

```console
$ uv pip install --group some/path/pyproject.toml:foo --group other/pyproject.toml:bar
```

!!! note

    As in pip, `--group` flags do not apply to other sources specified with flags like `-r` or -e`.
    For instance, `uv pip install -r some/path/pyproject.toml --group foo` sources `foo`
    from `./pyproject.toml` and **not** `some/path/pyproject.toml`.

## Uninstalling a package

To uninstall a package, e.g., Flask:

```console
$ uv pip uninstall flask
```

To uninstall multiple packages, e.g., Flask and Ruff:

```console
$ uv pip uninstall flask ruff
```

### [`build-constraint-dependencies`](#build-constraint-dependencies) {: #build-constraint-dependencies }

Constraints to apply when solving build dependencies.

Build constraints are used to restrict the versions of build dependencies that are selected
when building a package during resolution or installation.

Including a package as a constraint will _not_ trigger installation of the package during
a build; instead, the package must be requested elsewhere in the project's build dependency
graph.

!!! note
    In `uv lock`, `uv sync`, and `uv run`, uv will only read `build-constraint-dependencies` from
    the `pyproject.toml` at the workspace root, and will ignore any declarations in other
    workspace members or `uv.toml` files.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
# Ensure that the setuptools v60.0.0 is used whenever a package has a build dependency
# on setuptools.
build-constraint-dependencies = [&quot;setuptools==60.0.0&quot;]
```

---

### [`conflicts`](#conflicts) {: #conflicts }

Declare collections of extras or dependency groups that are conflicting
(i.e., mutually exclusive).

It's useful to declare conflicts when two or more extras have mutually
incompatible dependencies. For example, extra `foo` might depend
on `numpy==2.0.0` while extra `bar` depends on `numpy==2.1.0`. While these
dependencies conflict, it may be the case that users are not expected to
activate both `foo` and `bar` at the same time, making it possible to
generate a universal resolution for the project despite the incompatibility.

By making such conflicts explicit, uv can generate a universal resolution
for a project, taking into account that certain combinations of extras and
groups are mutually exclusive. In exchange, installation will fail if a
user attempts to activate both conflicting extras.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[list[dict]]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
# Require that `package[extra1]` and `package[extra2]` are resolved
# in different forks so that they cannot conflict with one another.
conflicts = [
    [
        { extra = &quot;extra1&quot; },
        { extra = &quot;extra2&quot; },
    ]
]

# Require that the dependency groups `group1` and `group2`
# are resolved in different forks so that they cannot conflict
# with one another.
conflicts = [
    [
        { group = &quot;group1&quot; },
        { group = &quot;group2&quot; },
    ]
]
```

---

### [`constraint-dependencies`](#constraint-dependencies) {: #constraint-dependencies }

Constraints to apply when resolving the project's dependencies.

Constraints are used to restrict the versions of dependencies that are selected during
resolution.

Including a package as a constraint will _not_ trigger installation of the package on its
own; instead, the package must be requested elsewhere in the project's first-party or
transitive dependencies.

!!! note
    In `uv lock`, `uv sync`, and `uv run`, uv will only read `constraint-dependencies` from
    the `pyproject.toml` at the workspace root, and will ignore any declarations in other
    workspace members or `uv.toml` files.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
# Ensure that the grpcio version is always less than 1.65, if it's requested by a
# direct or transitive dependency.
constraint-dependencies = [&quot;grpcio&lt;1.65&quot;]
```

---

### [`default-groups`](#default-groups) {: #default-groups }

The list of `dependency-groups` to install by default.

Can also be the literal &quot;all&quot; to default enable all groups.

**Default value**: `[&quot;dev&quot;]`

**Type**: `str | list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
default-groups = [&quot;docs&quot;]
```

---

### [`dev-dependencies`](#dev-dependencies) {: #dev-dependencies }

The project's development dependencies.

Development dependencies will be installed by default in `uv run` and `uv sync`, but will
not appear in the project's published metadata.

Use of this field is not recommend anymore. Instead, use the `dependency-groups.dev` field
which is a standardized way to declare development dependencies. The contents of
`tool.uv.dev-dependencies` and `dependency-groups.dev` are combined to determine the final
requirements of the `dev` dependency group.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [&quot;ruff==0.5.0&quot;]
```

---

### [`environments`](#environments) {: #environments }

A list of supported environments against which to resolve dependencies.

By default, uv will resolve for all possible environments during a `uv lock` operation.
However, you can restrict the set of supported environments to improve performance and avoid
unsatisfiable branches in the solution space.

These environments will also be respected when `uv pip compile` is invoked with the
`--universal` flag.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `str | list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
# Resolve for macOS, but not for Linux or Windows.
environments = [&quot;sys_platform == 'darwin'&quot;]
```

---

### [`index`](#index) {: #index }

The indexes to use when resolving dependencies.

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

Indexes are considered in the order in which they're defined, such that the first-defined
index has the highest priority. Further, the indexes provided by this setting are given
higher priority than any indexes specified via [`index_url`](#index-url) or
[`extra_index_url`](#extra-index-url). uv will only consider the first index that contains
a given package, unless an alternative [index strategy](#index-strategy) is specified.

If an index is marked as `explicit = true`, it will be used exclusively for the
dependencies that select it explicitly via `[tool.uv.sources]`, as in:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121&quot;
explicit = true

[tool.uv.sources]
torch = { index = &quot;pytorch&quot; }
```

If an index is marked as `default = true`, it will be moved to the end of the prioritized list, such that it is
given the lowest priority when resolving packages. Additionally, marking an index as default will disable the
PyPI default index.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `dict`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121&quot;
```

---

### [`managed`](#managed) {: #managed }

Whether the project is managed by uv. If `false`, uv will ignore the project when
`uv run` is invoked.

**Default value**: `true`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
managed = false
```

---

### [`override-dependencies`](#override-dependencies) {: #override-dependencies }

Overrides to apply when resolving the project's dependencies.

Overrides are used to force selection of a specific version of a package, regardless of the
version requested by any other package, and regardless of whether choosing that version
would typically constitute an invalid resolution.

While constraints are _additive_, in that they're combined with the requirements of the
constituent packages, overrides are _absolute_, in that they completely replace the
requirements of any constituent packages.

Including a package as an override will _not_ trigger installation of the package on its
own; instead, the package must be requested elsewhere in the project's first-party or
transitive dependencies.

!!! note
    In `uv lock`, `uv sync`, and `uv run`, uv will only read `override-dependencies` from
    the `pyproject.toml` at the workspace root, and will ignore any declarations in other
    workspace members or `uv.toml` files.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
# Always install Werkzeug 2.3.0, regardless of whether transitive dependencies request
# a different version.
override-dependencies = [&quot;werkzeug==2.3.0&quot;]
```

---

### [`package`](#package) {: #package }

Whether the project should be considered a Python package, or a non-package (&quot;virtual&quot;)
project.

Packages are built and installed into the virtual environment in editable mode and thus
require a build backend, while virtual projects are _not_ built or installed; instead, only
their dependencies are included in the virtual environment.

Creating a package requires that a `build-system` is present in the `pyproject.toml`, and
that the project adheres to a structure that adheres to the build backend's expectations
(e.g., a `src` layout).

**Default value**: `true`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
package = false
```

---

### [`required-environments`](#required-environments) {: #required-environments }

A list of required platforms, for packages that lack source distributions.

When a package does not have a source distribution, it's availability will be limited to
the platforms supported by its built distributions (wheels). For example, if a package only
publishes wheels for Linux, then it won't be installable on macOS or Windows.

By default, uv requires each package to include at least one wheel that is compatible with
the designated Python version. The `required-environments` setting can be used to ensure that
the resulting resolution contains wheels for specific platforms, or fails if no such wheels
are available.

While the `environments` setting _limits_ the set of environments that uv will consider when
resolving dependencies, `required-environments` _expands_ the set of platforms that uv _must_
support when resolving dependencies.

For example, `environments = [&quot;sys_platform == 'darwin'&quot;]` would limit uv to solving for
macOS (and ignoring Linux and Windows). On the other hand, `required-environments = [&quot;sys_platform == 'darwin'&quot;]`
would _require_ that any package without a source distribution include a wheel for macOS in
order to be installable.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `str | list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
# Require that the package is available for macOS ARM and x86 (Intel).
required-environments = [
    &quot;sys_platform == 'darwin' and platform_machine == 'arm64'&quot;,
    &quot;sys_platform == 'darwin' and platform_machine == 'x86_64'&quot;,
]
```

---

### [`sources`](#sources) {: #sources }

The sources to use when resolving dependencies.

`tool.uv.sources` enriches the dependency metadata with additional sources, incorporated
during development. A dependency source can be a Git repository, a URL, a local path, or an
alternative registry.

See [Dependencies](../concepts/projects/dependencies.md) for more.

**Default value**: `{}`

**Type**: `dict`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

[tool.uv.sources]
httpx = { git = &quot;https://github.com/encode/httpx&quot;, tag = &quot;0.27.0&quot; }
pytest = { url = &quot;https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/6b/77/7440a06a8ead44c7757a64362dd22df5760f9b12dc5f11b6188cd2fc27a0/pytest-8.3.3-py3-none-any.whl&quot; }
pydantic = { path = &quot;/path/to/pydantic&quot;, editable = true }
```

---

### `workspace`

#### [`exclude`](#workspace_exclude) {: #workspace_exclude }
&lt;span id=&quot;exclude&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Packages to exclude as workspace members. If a package matches both `members` and
`exclude`, it will be excluded.

Supports both globs and explicit paths.

For more information on the glob syntax, refer to the [`glob` documentation](https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/struct.Pattern.html).

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv.workspace]
exclude = [&quot;member1&quot;, &quot;path/to/member2&quot;, &quot;libs/*&quot;]
```

---

#### [`members`](#workspace_members) {: #workspace_members }
&lt;span id=&quot;members&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Packages to include as workspace members.

Supports both globs and explicit paths.

For more information on the glob syntax, refer to the [`glob` documentation](https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/struct.Pattern.html).

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [&quot;member1&quot;, &quot;path/to/member2&quot;, &quot;libs/*&quot;]
```

---

## Configuration
### [`allow-insecure-host`](#allow-insecure-host) {: #allow-insecure-host }

Allow insecure connections to host.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g.,
`localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate
store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it
bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    allow-insecure-host = [&quot;localhost:8080&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    allow-insecure-host = [&quot;localhost:8080&quot;]
    ```

---

### [`cache-dir`](#cache-dir) {: #cache-dir }

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on Linux and macOS, and
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    cache-dir = &quot;./.uv_cache&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    cache-dir = &quot;./.uv_cache&quot;
    ```

---

### [`cache-keys`](#cache-keys) {: #cache-keys }

The keys to consider when caching builds for the project.

Cache keys enable you to specify the files or directories that should trigger a rebuild when
modified. By default, uv will rebuild a project whenever the `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`,
or `setup.cfg` files in the project directory are modified, or if a `src` directory is
added or removed, i.e.:

```toml
cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }, { file = &quot;setup.py&quot; }, { file = &quot;setup.cfg&quot; }, { dir = &quot;src&quot; }]
```

As an example: if a project uses dynamic metadata to read its dependencies from a
`requirements.txt` file, you can specify `cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;requirements.txt&quot; }, { file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }]`
to ensure that the project is rebuilt whenever the `requirements.txt` file is modified (in
addition to watching the `pyproject.toml`).

Globs are supported, following the syntax of the [`glob`](https://docs.rs/glob/0.3.1/glob/struct.Pattern.html)
crate. For example, to invalidate the cache whenever a `.toml` file in the project directory
or any of its subdirectories is modified, you can specify `cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;**/*.toml&quot; }]`.
Note that the use of globs can be expensive, as uv may need to walk the filesystem to
determine whether any files have changed.

Cache keys can also include version control information. For example, if a project uses
`setuptools_scm` to read its version from a Git commit, you can specify `cache-keys = [{ git = { commit = true }, { file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }]`
to include the current Git commit hash in the cache key (in addition to the
`pyproject.toml`). Git tags are also supported via `cache-keys = [{ git = { commit = true, tags = true } }]`.

Cache keys can also include environment variables. For example, if a project relies on
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` or other environment variables to determine its behavior, you can
specify `cache-keys = [{ env = &quot;MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET&quot; }]` to invalidate the cache
whenever the environment variable changes.

Cache keys only affect the project defined by the `pyproject.toml` in which they're
specified (as opposed to, e.g., affecting all members in a workspace), and all paths and
globs are interpreted as relative to the project directory.

**Default value**: `[{ file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }, { file = &quot;setup.py&quot; }, { file = &quot;setup.cfg&quot; }]`

**Type**: `list[dict]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }, { file = &quot;requirements.txt&quot; }, { git = { commit = true } }]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; }, { file = &quot;requirements.txt&quot; }, { git = { commit = true } }]
    ```

---

### [`check-url`](#check-url) {: #check-url }

Check an index URL for existing files to skip duplicate uploads.

This option allows retrying publishing that failed after only some, but not all files have
been uploaded, and handles error due to parallel uploads of the same file.

Before uploading, the index is checked. If the exact same file already exists in the index,
the file will not be uploaded. If an error occurred during the upload, the index is checked
again, to handle cases where the identical file was uploaded twice in parallel.

The exact behavior will vary based on the index. When uploading to PyPI, uploading the same
file succeeds even without `--check-url`, while most other indexes error.

The index must provide one of the supported hashes (SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512).

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    check-url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/simple&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    check-url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/simple&quot;
    ```

---

### [`compile-bytecode`](#compile-bytecode) {: #compile-bytecode }

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`);
instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases
in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option
can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that
are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also
ignore errors.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    compile-bytecode = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    compile-bytecode = true
    ```

    [tool.uv]
    config-settings = { editable_mode = &quot;compat&quot; }
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    config-settings = { editable_mode = &quot;compat&quot; }
    ```

---

### [`dependency-metadata`](#dependency-metadata) {: #dependency-metadata }

Pre-defined static metadata for dependencies of the project (direct or transitive). When
provided, enables the resolver to use the specified metadata instead of querying the
registry or building the relevant package from source.

Metadata should be provided in adherence with the [Metadata 2.3](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/)
standard, though only the following fields are respected:

- `name`: The name of the package.
- (Optional) `version`: The version of the package. If omitted, the metadata will be applied
  to all versions of the package.
- (Optional) `requires-dist`: The dependencies of the package (e.g., `werkzeug&gt;=0.14`).
- (Optional) `requires-python`: The Python version required by the package (e.g., `&gt;=3.10`).
- (Optional) `provides-extras`: The extras provided by the package.

    [tool.uv]
    dependency-metadata = [
        { name = &quot;flask&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, requires-dist = [&quot;werkzeug&quot;], requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.6&quot; },
    ]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    dependency-metadata = [
        { name = &quot;flask&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, requires-dist = [&quot;werkzeug&quot;], requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.6&quot; },
    ]
    ```

---

### [`exclude-newer`](#exclude-newer) {: #exclude-newer }

Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html) timestamps (e.g.,
`2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your
system's configured time zone.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    exclude-newer = &quot;2006-12-02&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    exclude-newer = &quot;2006-12-02&quot;
    ```

---

### [`extra-index-url`](#extra-index-url) {: #extra-index-url }

Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by
[`index_url`](#index-url) or [`index`](#index) with `default = true`. When multiple indexes
are provided, earlier values take priority.

To control uv's resolution strategy when multiple indexes are present, see
[`index_strategy`](#index-strategy).

(Deprecated: use `index` instead.)

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    extra-index-url = [&quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    extra-index-url = [&quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu&quot;]
    ```

---

### [`find-links`](#find-links) {: #find-links }

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry
indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or
source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the
formats described above.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    find-links = [&quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    find-links = [&quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html&quot;]
    ```

---

### [`fork-strategy`](#fork-strategy) {: #fork-strategy }

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python
versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each
supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected
versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package,
preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python
versions or platforms.

**Default value**: `&quot;requires-python&quot;`

**Possible values**:

- `&quot;fewest&quot;`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `&quot;requires-python&quot;`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    fork-strategy = &quot;fewest&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    fork-strategy = &quot;fewest&quot;
    ```

---

### [`index`](#index) {: #index }

The package indexes to use when resolving dependencies.

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

Indexes are considered in the order in which they're defined, such that the first-defined
index has the highest priority. Further, the indexes provided by this setting are given
higher priority than any indexes specified via [`index_url`](#index-url) or
[`extra_index_url`](#extra-index-url). uv will only consider the first index that contains
a given package, unless an alternative [index strategy](#index-strategy) is specified.

If an index is marked as `explicit = true`, it will be used exclusively for those
dependencies that select it explicitly via `[tool.uv.sources]`, as in:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121&quot;
explicit = true

[tool.uv.sources]
torch = { index = &quot;pytorch&quot; }
```

If an index is marked as `default = true`, it will be moved to the end of the prioritized list, such that it is
given the lowest priority when resolving packages. Additionally, marking an index as default will disable the
PyPI default index.

**Default value**: `&quot;[]&quot;`

**Type**: `dict`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [[tool.uv.index]]
    name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
    url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [[tool.uv.index]]
    name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
    url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121&quot;
    ```

---

### [`index-strategy`](#index-strategy) {: #index-strategy }

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and
limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents
&quot;dependency confusion&quot; attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the
same name to an alternate index.

**Default value**: `&quot;first-index&quot;`

**Possible values**:

- `&quot;first-index&quot;`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `&quot;unsafe-first-match&quot;`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `&quot;unsafe-best-match&quot;`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the &quot;best&quot; version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    index-strategy = &quot;unsafe-best-match&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    index-strategy = &quot;unsafe-best-match&quot;
    ```

---

### [`index-url`](#index-url) {: #index-url }

The URL of the Python package index (by default: &lt;https://pypi.org/simple&gt;).

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index provided by this setting is given lower priority than any indexes specified via
[`extra_index_url`](#extra-index-url) or [`index`](#index).

(Deprecated: use `index` instead.)

**Default value**: `&quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot;`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    index-url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/simple&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    index-url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/simple&quot;
    ```

---

### [`keyring-provider`](#keyring-provider) {: #keyring-provider }

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to
use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

**Default value**: `&quot;disabled&quot;`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    keyring-provider = &quot;subprocess&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    keyring-provider = &quot;subprocess&quot;
    ```

---

### [`link-mode`](#link-mode) {: #link-mode }

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and
Windows.

**Default value**: `&quot;clone&quot; (macOS) or &quot;hardlink&quot; (Linux, Windows)`

**Possible values**:

- `&quot;clone&quot;`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `&quot;copy&quot;`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `&quot;hardlink&quot;`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `&quot;symlink&quot;`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    link-mode = &quot;copy&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    link-mode = &quot;copy&quot;
    ```

---

### [`native-tls`](#native-tls) {: #native-tls }

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The
`webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv
improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store,
especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's
included in your system's certificate store.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    native-tls = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    native-tls = true
    ```

---

### [`no-binary`](#no-binary) {: #no-binary }

Don't install pre-built wheels.

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    no-binary = true
    ```

    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    no-binary-package = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```

---

### [`no-build`](#no-build) {: #no-build }

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of
already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building
distributions will exit with an error.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    no-build = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    no-build = true
    ```

---

### [`no-build-isolation`](#no-build-isolation) {: #no-build-isolation }

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    no-build-isolation = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    no-build-isolation = true
    ```

---

### [`no-build-isolation-package`](#no-build-isolation-package) {: #no-build-isolation-package }

Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.

Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/)
are already installed.

    ```toml
    no-cache = true
    ```

---

### [`no-index`](#no-index) {: #no-index }

Ignore all registry indexes (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and
those provided via `--find-links`.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

    ```toml
    no-index = true
    ```

---

### [`no-sources`](#no-sources) {: #no-sources }

Ignore the `tool.uv.sources` table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the
standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any local or Git
sources.

=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    offline = true
    ```

---

### [`prerelease`](#prerelease) {: #prerelease }

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases,
along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the
declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

**Default value**: `&quot;if-necessary-or-explicit&quot;`

**Possible values**:

- `&quot;disallow&quot;`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `&quot;allow&quot;`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `&quot;if-necessary&quot;`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `&quot;explicit&quot;`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
- `&quot;if-necessary-or-explicit&quot;`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    publish-url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/legacy/&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    publish-url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/legacy/&quot;
    ```

---

### [`pypy-install-mirror`](#pypy-install-mirror) {: #pypy-install-mirror }

Mirror URL to use for downloading managed PyPy installations.

By default, managed PyPy installations are downloaded from [downloads.python.org](https://downloads.python.org/).

    python-downloads = &quot;manual&quot;
    ```

---

### [`python-install-mirror`](#python-install-mirror) {: #python-install-mirror }

Mirror URL for downloading managed Python installations.

By default, managed Python installations are downloaded from [`python-build-standalone`](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone).
This variable can be set to a mirror URL to use a different source for Python installations.
The provided URL will replace `https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download` in, e.g., `https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download/20240713/cpython-3.12.4%2B20240713-aarch64-apple-darwin-install_only.tar.gz`.

package requirement.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (`highest`).

**Default value**: `&quot;highest&quot;`

**Possible values**:

- `&quot;highest&quot;`: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package

Only applies to `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg` sources.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    allow-empty-requirements = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    allow-empty-requirements = true
    ```

---

    annotation-style = &quot;line&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`break-system-packages`](#pip_break-system-packages) {: #pip_break-system-packages }
&lt;span id=&quot;break-system-packages&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Allow uv to modify an `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` Python installation.

WARNING: `--break-system-packages` is intended for use in continuous integration (CI)
environments, when installing into Python installations that are managed by an external
package manager, like `apt`. It should be used with caution, as such Python installations
explicitly recommend against modifications by other package managers (like uv or pip).

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    break-system-packages = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    break-system-packages = true
    ```

---

#### [`compile-bytecode`](#pip_compile-bytecode) {: #pip_compile-bytecode }
&lt;span id=&quot;compile-bytecode&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`);
instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases
in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option
can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that
are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also
ignore errors.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    compile-bytecode = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    compile-bytecode = true
    ```

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    config-settings = { editable_mode = &quot;compat&quot; }
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    config-settings = { editable_mode = &quot;compat&quot; }
    ```

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    custom-compile-command = &quot;./custom-uv-compile.sh&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    custom-compile-command = &quot;./custom-uv-compile.sh&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`dependency-metadata`](#pip_dependency-metadata) {: #pip_dependency-metadata }
&lt;span id=&quot;dependency-metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Pre-defined static metadata for dependencies of the project (direct or transitive). When
provided, enables the resolver to use the specified metadata instead of querying the

standard, though only the following fields are respected:

- `name`: The name of the package.
- (Optional) `version`: The version of the package. If omitted, the metadata will be applied
  to all versions of the package.
- (Optional) `requires-dist`: The dependencies of the package (e.g., `werkzeug&gt;=0.14`).
- (Optional) `requires-python`: The Python version required by the package (e.g., `&gt;=3.10`).

&lt;span id=&quot;extra-index-url&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by
[`index_url`](#index-url). When multiple indexes are provided, earlier values take priority.

To control uv's resolution strategy when multiple indexes are present, see
[`index_strategy`](#index-strategy).

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    extra-index-url = [&quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry
indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or
source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the
formats described above.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    find-links = [&quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    find-links = [&quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html&quot;]
    ```

---

#### [`fork-strategy`](#pip_fork-strategy) {: #pip_fork-strategy }
&lt;span id=&quot;fork-strategy&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python
versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each
supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected
versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package,
preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python
versions or platforms.

**Default value**: `&quot;requires-python&quot;`

**Possible values**:

- `&quot;fewest&quot;`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `&quot;requires-python&quot;`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    fork-strategy = &quot;fewest&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    generate-hashes = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    group = [&quot;dev&quot;, &quot;docs&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    group = [&quot;dev&quot;, &quot;docs&quot;]
    ```

---

#### [`index-strategy`](#pip_index-strategy) {: #pip_index-strategy }
&lt;span id=&quot;index-strategy&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and
limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents
&quot;dependency confusion&quot; attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the
same name to an alternate index.

**Default value**: `&quot;first-index&quot;`

**Possible values**:

- `&quot;first-index&quot;`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `&quot;unsafe-first-match&quot;`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `&quot;unsafe-best-match&quot;`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the &quot;best&quot; version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    index-strategy = &quot;unsafe-best-match&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    index-strategy = &quot;unsafe-best-match&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`index-url`](#pip_index-url) {: #pip_index-url }
&lt;span id=&quot;index-url&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The URL of the Python package index (by default: &lt;https://pypi.org/simple&gt;).

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index provided by this setting is given lower priority than any indexes specified via
[`extra_index_url`](#extra-index-url).

**Default value**: `&quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot;`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    index-url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/simple&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    index-url = &quot;https://test.pypi.org/simple&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`keyring-provider`](#pip_keyring-provider) {: #pip_keyring-provider }
&lt;span id=&quot;keyring-provider&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to
use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

**Default value**: `disabled`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    keyring-provider = &quot;subprocess&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    keyring-provider = &quot;subprocess&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`link-mode`](#pip_link-mode) {: #pip_link-mode }
&lt;span id=&quot;link-mode&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and
Windows.

**Default value**: `&quot;clone&quot; (macOS) or &quot;hardlink&quot; (Linux, Windows)`

**Possible values**:

- `&quot;clone&quot;`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `&quot;copy&quot;`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `&quot;hardlink&quot;`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `&quot;symlink&quot;`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    link-mode = &quot;copy&quot;
    ```

    [pip]
    link-mode = &quot;copy&quot;
    ```

---

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-binary = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-binary = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```

#### [`no-build`](#pip_no-build) {: #pip_no-build }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-build&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of
already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building
distributions will exit with an error.

Alias for `--only-binary :all:`.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-build = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-build = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-build-isolation`](#pip_no-build-isolation) {: #pip_no-build-isolation }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-build-isolation&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/)
are already installed.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-build-isolation = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-build-isolation = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-build-isolation-package`](#pip_no-build-isolation-package) {: #pip_no-build-isolation-package }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-build-isolation-package&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.

Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/)
are already installed.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-build-isolation-package = [&quot;package1&quot;, &quot;package2&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-build-isolation-package = [&quot;package1&quot;, &quot;package2&quot;]
    ```

---

#### [`no-deps`](#pip_no-deps) {: #pip_no-deps }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-deps&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Ignore package dependencies, instead only add those packages explicitly listed
on the command line to the resulting requirements file.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-deps = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-deps = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-emit-package`](#pip_no-emit-package) {: #pip_no-emit-package }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-emit-package&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Specify a package to omit from the output resolution. Its dependencies will still be
included in the resolution. Equivalent to pip-compile's `--unsafe-package` option.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-emit-package = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-emit-package = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```

---

#### [`no-extra`](#pip_no-extra) {: #pip_no-extra }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-extra&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Exclude the specified optional dependencies if `all-extras` is supplied.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    all-extras = true
    no-extra = [&quot;dev&quot;, &quot;docs&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    all-extras = true
    no-extra = [&quot;dev&quot;, &quot;docs&quot;]
    ```

---

#### [`no-header`](#pip_no-header) {: #pip_no-header }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-header&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Exclude the comment header at the top of output file generated by `uv pip compile`.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-header = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-header = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-index`](#pip_no-index) {: #pip_no-index }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-index&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Ignore all registry indexes (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and
those provided via `--find-links`.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-index = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-index = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-sources`](#pip_no-sources) {: #pip_no-sources }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-sources&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Ignore the `tool.uv.sources` table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the
standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any local or Git
sources.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-sources = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-sources = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-strip-extras`](#pip_no-strip-extras) {: #pip_no-strip-extras }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-strip-extras&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Include extras in the output file.

By default, uv strips extras, as any packages pulled in by the extras are already included
as dependencies in the output file directly. Further, output files generated with
`--no-strip-extras` cannot be used as constraints files in `install` and `sync` invocations.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-strip-extras = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-strip-extras = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-strip-markers`](#pip_no-strip-markers) {: #pip_no-strip-markers }
&lt;span id=&quot;no-strip-markers&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Include environment markers in the output file generated by `uv pip compile`.

By default, uv strips environment markers, as the resolution generated by `compile` is
only guaranteed to be correct for the target environment.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-strip-markers = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-strip-markers = true
    ```

---

#### [`only-binary`](#pip_only-binary) {: #pip_only-binary }
&lt;span id=&quot;only-binary&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Only use pre-built wheels; don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run code from the given packages. The cached wheels of already-built
source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will
exit with an error.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with `:all:`.
Clear previously specified packages with `:none:`.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    only-binary = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    only-binary = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```

---

#### [`output-file`](#pip_output-file) {: #pip_output-file }
&lt;span id=&quot;output-file&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Write the requirements generated by `uv pip compile` to the given `requirements.txt` file.

If the file already exists, the existing versions will be preferred when resolving
dependencies, unless `--upgrade` is also specified.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    output-file = &quot;requirements.txt&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    output-file = &quot;requirements.txt&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`prefix`](#pip_prefix) {: #pip_prefix }
&lt;span id=&quot;prefix&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Install packages into `lib`, `bin`, and other top-level folders under the specified
directory, as if a virtual environment were present at that location.

In general, prefer the use of `--python` to install into an alternate environment, as
scripts and other artifacts installed via `--prefix` will reference the installing
interpreter, rather than any interpreter added to the `--prefix` directory, rendering them
non-portable.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    prefix = &quot;./prefix&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    prefix = &quot;./prefix&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`prerelease`](#pip_prerelease) {: #pip_prerelease }
&lt;span id=&quot;prerelease&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases,
along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the
declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

**Default value**: `&quot;if-necessary-or-explicit&quot;`

**Possible values**:

- `&quot;disallow&quot;`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `&quot;allow&quot;`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `&quot;if-necessary&quot;`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `&quot;explicit&quot;`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
- `&quot;if-necessary-or-explicit&quot;`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    prerelease = &quot;allow&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    prerelease = &quot;allow&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`python`](#pip_python) {: #pip_python }
&lt;span id=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The Python interpreter into which packages should be installed.

By default, uv installs into the virtual environment in the current working directory or
any parent directory. The `--python` option allows you to specify a different interpreter,
which is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments or other automated
workflows.

Supported formats:
- `3.10` looks for an installed Python 3.10 in the registry on Windows (see
  `py --list-paths`), or `python3.10` on Linux and macOS.
- `python3.10` or `python.exe` looks for a binary with the given name in `PATH`.
- `/home/ferris/.local/bin/python3.10` uses the exact Python at the given path.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    python = &quot;3.10&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    python = &quot;3.10&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`python-platform`](#pip_python-platform) {: #pip_python-platform }
&lt;span id=&quot;python-platform&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The platform for which requirements should be resolved.

Represented as a &quot;target triple&quot;, a string that describes the target platform in terms of
its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or
`aarch64-apple-darwin`.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    python-platform = &quot;x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    python-platform = &quot;x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`python-version`](#pip_python-version) {: #pip_python-version }
&lt;span id=&quot;python-version&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The minimum Python version that should be supported by the resolved requirements (e.g.,
`3.8` or `3.8.17`).

If a patch version is omitted, the minimum patch version is assumed. For example, `3.8` is
mapped to `3.8.0`.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    python-version = &quot;3.8&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    python-version = &quot;3.8&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`reinstall`](#pip_reinstall) {: #pip_reinstall }
&lt;span id=&quot;reinstall&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Reinstall all packages, regardless of whether they're already installed. Implies `refresh`.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    reinstall = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    reinstall = true
    ```

---

#### [`reinstall-package`](#pip_reinstall-package) {: #pip_reinstall-package }
&lt;span id=&quot;reinstall-package&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Reinstall a specific package, regardless of whether it's already installed. Implies
`refresh-package`.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    reinstall-package = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    reinstall-package = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```

---

#### [`require-hashes`](#pip_require-hashes) {: #pip_require-hashes }
&lt;span id=&quot;require-hashes&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Require a matching hash for each requirement.

Hash-checking mode is all or nothing. If enabled, _all_ requirements must be provided
with a corresponding hash or set of hashes. Additionally, if enabled, _all_ requirements
must either be pinned to exact versions (e.g., `==1.0.0`), or be specified via direct URL.

Hash-checking mode introduces a number of additional constraints:

- Git dependencies are not supported.
- Editable installs are not supported.
- Local dependencies are not supported, unless they point to a specific wheel (`.whl`) or
  source archive (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`), as opposed to a directory.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    require-hashes = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    require-hashes = true
    ```

---

#### [`resolution`](#pip_resolution) {: #pip_resolution }
&lt;span id=&quot;resolution&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given
package requirement.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (`highest`).

**Default value**: `&quot;highest&quot;`

**Possible values**:

- `&quot;highest&quot;`: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
- `&quot;lowest&quot;`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
- `&quot;lowest-direct&quot;`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    resolution = &quot;lowest-direct&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    resolution = &quot;lowest-direct&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`strict`](#pip_strict) {: #pip_strict }
&lt;span id=&quot;strict&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Validate the Python environment, to detect packages with missing dependencies and other
issues.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    strict = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    strict = true
    ```

---

#### [`system`](#pip_system) {: #pip_system }
&lt;span id=&quot;system&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Install packages into the system Python environment.

By default, uv installs into the virtual environment in the current working directory or
any parent directory. The `--system` option instructs uv to instead use the first Python
found in the system `PATH`.

WARNING: `--system` is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments and
should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    system = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    system = true
    ```

---

#### [`target`](#pip_target) {: #pip_target }
&lt;span id=&quot;target&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Install packages into the specified directory, rather than into the virtual or system Python
environment. The packages will be installed at the top-level of the directory.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    target = &quot;./target&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    target = &quot;./target&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`torch-backend`](#pip_torch-backend) {: #pip_torch-backend }
&lt;span id=&quot;torch-backend&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The backend to use when fetching packages in the PyTorch ecosystem.

When set, uv will ignore the configured index URLs for packages in the PyTorch ecosystem,
and will instead use the defined backend.

For example, when set to `cpu`, uv will use the CPU-only PyTorch index; when set to `cu126`,
uv will use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.6.

The `auto` mode will attempt to detect the appropriate PyTorch index based on the currently
installed CUDA drivers.

This option is in preview and may change in any future release.

**Default value**: `null`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    torch-backend = &quot;auto&quot;
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    torch-backend = &quot;auto&quot;
    ```

---

#### [`universal`](#pip_universal) {: #pip_universal }
&lt;span id=&quot;universal&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Perform a universal resolution, attempting to generate a single `requirements.txt` output
file that is compatible with all operating systems, architectures, and Python
implementations.

In universal mode, the current Python version (or user-provided `--python-version`) will be
treated as a lower bound. For example, `--universal --python-version 3.7` would produce a
universal resolution for Python 3.7 and later.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    universal = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    universal = true
    ```

---

#### [`upgrade`](#pip_upgrade) {: #pip_upgrade }
&lt;span id=&quot;upgrade&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Allow package upgrades, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    upgrade = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    upgrade = true
    ```

---

#### [`upgrade-package`](#pip_upgrade-package) {: #pip_upgrade-package }
&lt;span id=&quot;upgrade-package&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Allow upgrades for a specific package, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output
file.

Accepts both standalone package names (`ruff`) and version specifiers (`ruff&lt;0.5.0`).

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    upgrade-package = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    upgrade-package = [&quot;ruff&quot;]
    ```

---

#### [`verify-hashes`](#pip_verify-hashes) {: #pip_verify-hashes }
&lt;span id=&quot;verify-hashes&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Validate any hashes provided in the requirements file.

Unlike `--require-hashes`, `--verify-hashes` does not require that all requirements have
hashes; instead, it will limit itself to verifying the hashes of those requirements that do
include them.

**Default value**: `true`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== &quot;pyproject.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    verify-hashes = true
    ```
=== &quot;uv.toml&quot;

    ```toml
    [pip]
    verify-hashes = true
    ```

          <file path="docs/reference/policies/platforms.md"># Platform support

uv has Tier 1 support for the following platforms:

- macOS (Apple Silicon)
- macOS (x86_64)
- Linux (x86_64)
- Windows (x86_64)

uv is continuously built, tested, and developed against its Tier 1 platforms. Inspired by the Rust
project, Tier 1 can be thought of as
[&quot;guaranteed to work&quot;](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rustc/platform-support.html).

uv has Tier 2 support
([&quot;guaranteed to build&quot;](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rustc/platform-support.html)) for the
following platforms:

- Linux (PPC64)
- Linux (PPC64LE)
- Linux (aarch64)
- Linux (armv7)
- Linux (i686)
- Linux (s390x)

uv ships pre-built wheels to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/) for its Tier 1 and Tier 2
platforms. However, while Tier 2 platforms are continuously built, they are not continuously tested
or developed against, and so stability may vary in practice.

Beyond the Tier 1 and Tier 2 platforms, uv is known to build on i686 Windows, and known _not_ to
build on aarch64 Windows, but does not consider either platform to be supported at this time. The
minimum supported Windows versions are Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, following
[Rust's own Tier 1 support](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/02/26/Windows-7.html).

uv supports and is tested against Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.
</file>
          <file path="docs/reference/policies/versioning.md"># Versioning

uv uses a custom versioning scheme in which the minor version number is bumped for breaking changes,
and the patch version number is bumped for bug fixes, enhancements, and other non-breaking changes.

uv is widely used in production. However, we value the ability to iterate on new features quickly
and gather changes that _could_ be breaking into clearly marked releases.

Once uv v1.0.0 is released, the versioning scheme will adhere to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). There is not a particular goal that must be achieved for
uv to reach this milestone.

uv's changelog can be [viewed on GitHub](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Cache versioning

Cache versions are considered internal to uv, and so may be changed in a minor or patch release. See
[Cache versioning](../../concepts/cache.md#cache-versioning) for more.

## Lockfile versioning

The `uv.lock` schema version is considered part of the public API, and so will only be incremented
in a minor release as a breaking change. See
[Lockfile versioning](../../concepts/resolution.md#lockfile-versioning) for more.

## Minimum supported Rust version

The minimum supported Rust version required to compile uv is listed in the `rust-version` key of the
`[workspace.package]` section in `Cargo.toml`. It may change in any release (minor or patch). It
will never be newer than N-2 Rust versions, where N is the latest stable version. For example, if
the latest stable Rust version is 1.85, uv's minimum supported Rust version will be at most 1.83.

This is only relevant to users who build uv from source. Installing uv from the Python package index
usually installs a pre-built binary and does not require Rust compilation.

          <file path="docs/reference/troubleshooting/build-failures.md"># Troubleshooting build failures

uv needs to build packages when there is not a compatible wheel (a pre-built distribution of the
package) available. Building packages can fail for many reasons, some of which may be unrelated to
uv itself.

## Recognizing a build failure

An example build failure can be produced by trying to install and old version of numpy on a new,
unsupported version of Python:

```console
$ uv pip install -p 3.13 'numpy&lt;1.20'
Resolved 1 package in 62ms
  √ó Failed to build `numpy==1.19.5`
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∂ The build backend returned an error
  ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Call to `setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__.build_wheel()` failed (exit status: 1)

      [stderr]
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
          from setuptools.build_meta import __legacy__ as backend
        File &quot;/home/konsti/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmpi4bgKb/lib/python3.13/site-packages/setuptools/__init__.py&quot;, line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
          import distutils.core
      ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'

      hint: `distutils` was removed from the standard library in Python 3.12. Consider adding a constraint (like `numpy &gt;1.19.5`) to avoid building a version of `numpy` that depends
      on `distutils`.
```

Notice that the error message is prefaced by &quot;The build backend returned an error&quot;.

The build failure includes the `[stderr]` (and `[stdout]`, if present) from the build backend that
was used for the build. The error logs are not from uv itself.

The message following the `‚ï∞‚îÄ‚ñ∂` is a hint provided by uv, to help resolve common build failures. A
hint will not be available for all build failures.

## Confirming that a build failure is specific to uv

Build failures are usually related to your system and the build backend. It is rare that a build
failure is specific to uv. You can confirm that the build failure is not related to uv by attempting
to reproduce it with pip:

```console
$ uv venv -p 3.13 --seed
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --use-pep517 --no-cache --force-reinstall 'numpy==1.19.5'

```

!!! important

    The `--use-pep517` flag should be included with the `pip install` invocation to ensure the same
    build isolation behavior. uv always uses [build isolation by default](../../pip/compatibility.md#pep-517-build-isolation).

    We also recommend including the `--force-reinstall` and `--no-cache` options when reproducing
    failures.

Since this build failure occurs in pip too, it is not likely to be a bug with uv.

If a build failure is reproducible with another installer, you should investigate upstream (in this
example, `numpy` or `setuptools`), find a way to avoid building the package in the first place, or
make the necessary adjustments to your system for the build to succeed.

## Why does uv build a package?

When generating the cross-platform lockfile, uv needs to determine the dependencies of all packages,
even those only installed on other platforms. uv tries to avoid package builds during resolution. It
uses any wheel if exist for that version, then tries to find static metadata in the source
distribution (mainly pyproject.toml with static `project.version`, `project.dependencies` and
`project.optional-dependencies` or METADATA v2.2+). Only if all of that fails, it builds the
package.

When installing, uv needs to have a wheel for the current platform for each package. If no matching
wheel exists in the index, uv tries to build the source distribution.

You can check which wheels exist for a PyPI project under ‚ÄúDownload Files‚Äù, e.g.
https://pypi.org/project/numpy/2.1.1.md#files. Wheels with `...-py3-none-any.whl` filenames work
everywhere, others have the operating system and platform in the filename. In the linked `numpy`
example, you can see that there are pre-built distributions for Python 3.10 to 3.13 on MacOS, Linux
and Windows.

## Common build failures

The following examples demonstrate common build failures and how to resolve them.

### Command is not found

If the build error mentions a missing command, for example, `gcc`:

&lt;!-- docker run --platform linux/x86_64 -it ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.10-bookworm-slim /bin/bash -c &quot;uv pip install --system pysha3==1.0.2&quot; --&gt;

```hl_lines=&quot;17&quot;
√ó Failed to build `pysha3==1.0.2`
‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∂ The build backend returned an error
‚ï∞‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Call to `setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__.build_wheel` failed (exit status: 1)

    [stdout]

    running build
    running build_py
    creating build/lib.linux-x86_64-cpython-310
    copying sha3.py -&gt; build/lib.linux-x86_64-cpython-310
    running build_ext
    building '_pysha3' extension
    creating build/temp.linux-x86_64-cpython-310/Modules/_sha3
    gcc -Wno-unused-result -Wsign-compare -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -fPIC -DPY_WITH_KECCAK=1 -I/root/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmp8V4iEk/include -I/usr/local/include/python3.10 -c
    Modules/_sha3/sha3module.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-cpython-310/Modules/_sha3/sha3module.o

    [stderr]
    error: command 'gcc' failed: No such file or directory
```

Then, you'll need to install it with your system package manager, e.g., to resolve the error above:

```console
$ apt install gcc
```

!!! tip

    When using the uv-managed Python versions, it's common to need `clang` installed instead of
    `gcc`.

    Many Linux distributions provide a package that includes all the common build dependencies.
    You can address most build requirements by installing it, e.g., for Debian or Ubuntu:

    ```console
    $ apt install build-essential
    ```

### Header or library is missing

If the build error mentions a missing header or library, e.g., a `.h` file, then you'll need to
install it with your system package manager.

For example, installing `pygraphviz` requires Graphviz to be installed:

&lt;!-- docker run --platform linux/x86_64 -it ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.12-bookworm /bin/bash -c &quot;uv pip install --system 'pygraphviz'&quot; --&gt;

```hl_lines=&quot;18-19&quot;
√ó Failed to build `pygraphviz==1.14`
‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∂ The build backend returned an error

  hint: This error likely indicates that you need to install a library that provides &quot;graphviz/cgraph.h&quot; for `pygraphviz@1.14`
```

To resolve this error on Debian, you'd install the `libgraphviz-dev` package:

```console
$ apt install libgraphviz-dev
```

Note that installing the `graphviz` package is not sufficient, the development headers need to be
installed.

!!! tip

    To resolve an error where `Python.h` is missing, install the [`python3-dev` package](https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/python3-dev).

### Module is missing or cannot be imported

If the build error mentions a failing import, consider
[disabling build isolation](../../concepts/projects/config.md#build-isolation).

For example, some packages assume that `pip` is available without declaring it as a build
dependency:

&lt;!-- docker run --platform linux/x86_64 -it ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.12-bookworm-slim /bin/bash -c &quot;uv pip install --system chumpy&quot; --&gt;

```hl_lines=&quot;7&quot;
  √ó Failed to build `chumpy==0.70`
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∂ The build backend returned an error
  ‚ï∞‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Call to `setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__.build_wheel` failed (exit status: 1)

    [stderr]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pip'

    During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 14, in &lt;module&gt;
      File &quot;/root/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmpvvHaxI/lib/python3.12/site-packages/setuptools/build_meta.py&quot;, line 334, in get_requires_for_build_wheel
        return self._get_build_requires(config_settings, requirements=[])
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File &quot;/root/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmpvvHaxI/lib/python3.12/site-packages/setuptools/build_meta.py&quot;, line 304, in _get_build_requires
        self.run_setup()
      File &quot;/root/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmpvvHaxI/lib/python3.12/site-packages/setuptools/build_meta.py&quot;, line 522, in run_setup
        super().run_setup(setup_script=setup_script)
      File &quot;/root/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmpvvHaxI/lib/python3.12/site-packages/setuptools/build_meta.py&quot;, line 320, in run_setup
        exec(code, locals())
      File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pip'
```

To resolve this error, pre-install the build dependencies then disable build isolation for the
package:

```console
$ uv pip install pip setuptools
$ uv pip install chumpy --no-build-isolation-package chumpy
```

Note you will need to install the missing package, e.g., `pip`, _and_ all the other build
dependencies of the package, e.g, `setuptools`.

### Old version of the package is built

If a package fails to build during resolution and the version that failed to build is older than the
version you want to use, try adding a [constraint](../settings.md#constraint-dependencies) with a
lower bound (e.g., `numpy&gt;=1.17`). Sometimes, due to algorithmic limitations, the uv resolver tries
to find a fitting version using unreasonably old packages, which can be prevented by using lower
bounds.

For example, when resolving the following dependencies on Python 3.10, uv attempts to build an old
version of `apache-beam`.

```title=&quot;requirements.txt&quot;
dill&lt;0.3.9,&gt;=0.2.2
apache-beam&lt;=2.49.0
```

&lt;!-- docker run --platform linux/x86_64 -it ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.10-bookworm-slim /bin/bash -c &quot;printf 'dill&lt;0.3.9,&gt;=0.2.2\napache-beam&lt;=2.49.0' | uv pip compile -&quot; --&gt;

```hl_lines=&quot;1&quot;
√ó Failed to build `apache-beam==2.0.0`
‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∂ The build backend returned an error
‚ï∞‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Call to `setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__.build_wheel` failed (exit status: 1)

    [stderr]
    ...
```

Adding a lower bound constraint, e.g., `apache-beam&lt;=2.49.0,&gt;2.30.0`, resolves this build failure as
uv will avoid using an old version of `apache-beam`.

Constraints can also be defined for indirect dependencies using `constraints.txt` files or the
[`constraint-dependencies`](../settings.md#constraint-dependencies) setting.

### Old Version of a build dependency is used

If a package fails to build because `uv` selects an incompatible or outdated version of a build-time
dependency, you can enforce constraints specifically for build dependencies. The
[`build-constraint-dependencies`](../settings.md#build-constraint-dependencies) setting (or an
analogous `build-constraints.txt` file) can be used to ensure that `uv` selects an appropriate
version of a given build requirements.

For example, the issue described in
[#5551](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5551#issuecomment-2256055975) could be addressed by
specifying a build constraint that excludes `setuptools` version `72.0.0`:

```toml title=&quot;pyproject.toml&quot;
[tool.uv]
# Prevent setuptools version 72.0.0 from being used as a build dependency.
build-constraint-dependencies = [&quot;setuptools!=72.0.0&quot;]
```

The build constraint will thus ensure that any package requiring `setuptools` during the build
process will avoid using the problematic version, preventing build failures caused by incompatible
build dependencies.

### Package is only needed for an unused platform

If locking fails due to building a package from a platform you do not need to support, consider
[limiting resolution](../../concepts/projects/config.md#limited-resolution-environments) to your
supported platforms.

### Package does not support all Python versions

If you support a large range of Python versions, consider using markers to use older versions for
older Python versions and newer versions for newer Python version. For example, `numpy` only
supports four Python minor version at a time, so to support a wider range of Python versions, e.g.,
Python 3.8 to 3.13, the `numpy` requirement needs to be split:

```
numpy&gt;=1.23; python_version &gt;= &quot;3.10&quot;
numpy&lt;1.23; python_version &lt; &quot;3.10&quot;
```

### Package is only usable on a specific platform

If locking fails due to building a package that is only usable on another platform, you can
[provide dependency metadata manually](../settings.md#dependency-metadata) to skip the build. uv can
not verify this information, so it is important to specify correct metadata when using this
override.
</file>
          <file path="docs/reference/troubleshooting/reproducible-examples.md"># Reproducible examples

## Why reproducible examples are important

A minimal reproducible example (MRE) is essential for fixing bugs. Without an example that can be
used to reproduce the problem, a maintainer cannot debug it or test if it is fixed. If the example
is not minimal, i.e., if it includes lots of content which is not related to the issue, it can take
a maintainer much longer to identify the root cause of the problem.

## How to write a reproducible example

When writing a reproducible example, the goal is to provide all of the context necessary for someone
else to reproduce your example. This includes:

- The platform you're using (e.g., the operating system and architecture)
- Any relevant system state (e.g., explicitly set environment variables)
- The version of uv
- The version of other relevant tools
- The relevant files (the `uv.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)
- The commands to run

To ensure your reproduction is minimal, remove as many dependencies, settings, and files as
possible. Be sure to test your reproduction before sharing it. We recommend including verbose logs
from your reproduction; they may differ on your machine in a critical way. Using a
[Gist](https://gist.github.com) can be helpful for very long logs.

Below, we'll cover several specific [strategies](#strategies-for-reproducible-examples) for creating
and sharing reproducible examples.

!!! tip

    There's a great guide to the basics of creating MREs on
    [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

## Strategies for reproducible examples

### Docker image

Writing a Docker image is often the best way to share a reproducible example because it is entirely
self-contained. This means that the state from the reproducer's system does not affect the problem.

!!! note

    Using a Docker image is only feasible if the issue is reproducible on Linux. When using macOS,
    it's prudent to ensure your image is not reproducible on Linux but some bugs _are_ specific
    to the operating system. While using Docker to run Windows containers is feasible, it's not
    commonplace. These sorts of bugs are expected to be reported as a [script](#script) instead.

When writing a Docker MRE with uv, it's best to start with one of
[uv's Docker images](../../guides/integration/docker.md#available-images). When doing so, be sure to
pin to a specific version of uv.

```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.5.24-debian-slim
```

While Docker images are isolated from the system, the build will use your system's architecture by
default. When sharing a reproduction, you can explicitly set the platform to ensure a reproducer
gets the expected behavior. uv publishes images for `linux/amd64` (e.g., Intel or AMD) and
`linux/arm64` (e.g., Apple M Series or ARM)

```Dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.5.24-debian-slim
```

Docker images are best for reproducing issues that can be constructed with commands, e.g.:

```Dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.5.24-debian-slim

RUN uv init /mre
WORKDIR /mre
RUN uv add pydantic
RUN uv sync
RUN uv run -v python -c &quot;import pydantic&quot;
```

However, you can also write files into the image inline:

```Dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.5.24-debian-slim

COPY &lt;&lt;EOF /mre/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = &quot;example&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;pydantic&quot;]
EOF

WORKDIR /mre
RUN uv lock
```

If you need to write many files, it's better to create and publish a
[Git repository](#git-repository). You can combine these approaches and include a `Dockerfile` in
the repository.

When sharing a Docker reproduction, it's helpful to include the build logs. You can see more output
from the build steps by disabling caching and the fancy output:

```console
docker build . --progress plain --no-cache
```

### Script

When reporting platform-specific bugs that cannot be reproduced in a [container](#docker-image),
it's best practice to include a script showing the commands that can be used to reproduce the bug,
e.g.:

```bash
uv init
uv add pydantic
uv sync
uv run -v python -c &quot;import pydantic&quot;
```

If your reproduction requires many files, use a [Git repository](#git-repository) to share them.

In addition to the script, include _verbose_ logs (i.e., with the `-v` flag) of the failure and the
complete error message.

Whenever a script relies on external state, be sure to share that information. For example, if you
wrote the script on Windows and it uses a Python version that you installed with `choco` and runs on
PowerShell 6.2, please include that in the report.

### Git repository

When sharing a Git repository reproduction, include a [script](#script) that reproduces the problem
or, even better, a [Dockerfile](#docker-image). The first step of the script should be to clone the
repository and checkout a specific commit:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;.git
$ cd &lt;project&gt;
$ git checkout &lt;commit&gt;
$ &lt;commands to produce error&gt;
```

You can quickly create a new repository in the [GitHub UI](https://github.com/new) or with the `gh`
CLI:

```console
$ gh repo create uv-mre-1234 --clone
```

When using a Git repository for a reproduction, please remember to _minimize_ the contents by
excluding files or settings that are not required to reproduce your problem.
</file>
        </dir>
      </dir>
    </dir>
  </files>
